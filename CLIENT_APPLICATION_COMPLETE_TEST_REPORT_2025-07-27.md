## Recommendations for v1.0.0

### HIGH Priority: Lock enum contracts to v1.0.0
Freeze document type enums with version control

**Implementation:** Update BACKEND_ENUM_TRUTH_SOURCE.md to v1.0.0 and enable strict contract enforcement

### HIGH Priority: Enable Test Mode for live applicants
Create test environment for real user validation

**Implementation:** Add VITE_TEST_MODE environment variable with test user flows

### MEDIUM Priority: Monitor enum divergence alerts
Set up automated monitoring for contract violations

**Implementation:** Configure alerts for CI failures and enum modification attempts

### MEDIUM Priority: Performance monitoring setup
Monitor application performance in production

**Implementation:** Add analytics tracking and performance metrics collection

### LOW Priority: Documentation updates
Update README and deployment guides

**Implementation:** Document v1.0.0 features and contract system for future developers

## Next Steps

1. Lock enum contracts to v1.0.0 for stability
2. Enable Test Mode for live applicant validation
3. Deploy to production environment
4. Monitor system performance and user feedback

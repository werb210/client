# DOCUMENT UPLOAD CODE LOCK POLICY

## üîí LOCKED COMPONENTS - AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED

**EFFECTIVE DATE**: July 17, 2025  
**LOCK STATUS**: ACTIVE  
**AUTHORIZATION LEVEL**: User Approval Required

### üö´ PROTECTED FILES - NO MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT USER APPROVAL

#### Document Upload Core Components
1. **client/src/components/upload/DocumentUploadWidget.tsx**
   - Console logging implementation: `console.log("üì§ Uploading document:", file.name, file.type, file.size)`
   - Upload response logging: `console.log("üì• Upload response:", result)`
   - Endpoint validation: `console.log("üîó Upload endpoint:", endpoint)`
   - Upload processing logic and error handling

2. **client/src/routes/Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx**
   - Document aggregation system
   - File upload workflow coordination
   - Application ID validation and storage

3. **client/src/routes/Step7_Finalization.tsx**
   - Final submission console logging: `console.log("üì§ [STEP7] Finalizing application:", applicationId)`
   - Document count logging: `console.log("üì§ [STEP7] Document Count:", uploadedFiles.length)`
   - Application finalization workflow

#### API Integration Components
4. **client/src/lib/api.ts**
   - Upload endpoint configuration: `/api/public/applications/:id/documents`
   - FormData structure and validation
   - Error handling and response processing

5. **server/index.ts**
   - Document upload route handlers
   - Staff backend integration and forwarding
   - Console logging: `üìÅ [SERVER] Document upload for application`
   - File metadata logging: `üìÅ [SERVER] File: [filename], Size: [bytes]`

#### Supporting Components
6. **client/src/components/DynamicDocumentRequirements.tsx**
   - Document requirement aggregation logic
   - Category-based document filtering
   - Upload state management

### üîê PROTECTED FUNCTIONALITY

#### Console Logging System
- **Upload start logging**: File name, type, and size tracking
- **Response logging**: Complete API response capture
- **Endpoint validation**: Path verification and confirmation
- **Finalization logging**: Application submission tracking

#### Upload Workflow
- **Endpoint structure**: `POST /api/public/applications/:id/documents`
- **FormData format**: `document` file + `documentType` category
- **Staff backend integration**: Request forwarding and response handling
- **Error handling**: Network failures, validation errors, and fallback mechanisms

#### State Management
- **Application ID flow**: Step 4 creation ‚Üí Step 5 uploads ‚Üí Step 7 finalization
- **Document persistence**: Upload tracking and completion validation
- **Cross-step coordination**: Form data synchronization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MODIFICATION PROTOCOL

#### Required Authorization Process
1. **User Approval Required**: All changes to locked components must receive explicit user authorization
2. **Change Documentation**: Modifications must be documented with rationale and impact assessment
3. **Testing Verification**: Any changes must undergo comprehensive testing before deployment
4. **Rollback Capability**: Backup versions maintained for emergency restoration

#### Authorized Modification Types
- Bug fixes that do not alter core functionality
- Performance optimizations that maintain existing behavior
- Security patches that preserve upload workflow integrity
- Console logging enhancements that extend (not replace) current implementation

#### Prohibited Modifications
- Removal or modification of console logging statements
- Changes to upload endpoint structure or routing
- Alterations to FormData format or field names
- Modifications to staff backend integration logic
- Changes to error handling or fallback mechanisms

### üìã COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

#### Pre-Modification Checklist
- [ ] User authorization obtained and documented
- [ ] Impact assessment completed
- [ ] Backup of current implementation created
- [ ] Test plan developed and approved
- [ ] Rollback procedure prepared

#### Post-Modification Validation
- [ ] Console logging functionality verified
- [ ] Upload workflow tested with real files
- [ ] Staff backend integration confirmed
- [ ] Error handling validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

### üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

#### Lock Override Protocol
In case of critical system failures:
1. Document the emergency situation
2. Implement minimal necessary changes
3. Restore locked functionality immediately after resolution
4. Report all modifications to user for approval

#### Lock Violation Response
If unauthorized modifications are detected:
1. Immediately halt further changes
2. Restore from backup if necessary
3. Document violation and impact
4. Require user re-authorization for any future changes

- **Static File Serving:** React SPA with catch-all routing
- **Health Check:** /health endpoint for monitoring
- **Environment:** Production secrets configured
- **Build Process:** Vite production build ready

### Current Deployment Issue Resolution
**Problem:** https://clientportal.boreal.financial serving static content instead of React app

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created `server.js` with proper Express configuration
2. Configured static file serving from `dist/public` directory
3. Added catch-all handler for React Router client-side navigation
4. Implemented health check endpoint for deployment verification
5. Triggered Replit deployment system to handle build process

### Production Server Code
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from Vite build output
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'public')));

// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'OK', service: 'Boreal Financial Client Portal' });
});

// Catch-all handler for React Router
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'public', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, '0.0.0.0');
```

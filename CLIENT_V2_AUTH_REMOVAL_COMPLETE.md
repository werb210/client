## 🎯 New Application Architecture

### User Journey Flow:
```
Landing Page (/)
    ↓
Simple Application (/simple-application)  
    ↓
Side-by-Side Application (/side-by-side-application)
    ↓
Step 1-6 (Direct access to any step)
    ↓
Document Upload & Signature
    ↓
Application Complete
```

### No Authentication Required:
- **Entry**: Users land directly on application without login
- **Navigation**: All routes publicly accessible
- **State**: Form data persists via localStorage, not user sessions
- **Workflow**: Complete 6-step application process without account creation

### Critical Blocker: SMS Document Upload Workflow

#### Issue Summary
The SMS link workflow that allows users to upload documents after application submission is failing. While URL parameter parsing works correctly, the document upload interface fails to render for users accessing the page via SMS links.

#### Technical Details
- **URL Parsing**: ‚úÖ Working correctly (extracts app ID from ?app= parameter)
- **API Authentication**: ‚ùå Staff backend returning 401 errors
- **Fallback Logic**: ‚ùå Multiple fallback attempts not activating properly
- **Document Cards**: ‚ùå Not rendering despite appId being available
- **User Impact**: Users see loading state indefinitely, cannot upload documents

#### Root Cause
The React component has complex conditional rendering logic that prevents the document upload interface from showing when the API fetch fails, even though fallback data is available.

#### Console Evidence
```
üîÑ [UploadDocuments] STEP 5 ARCHITECTURE - Loading page with app ID: 49bd45ff-e466-4baa-b08d-cac46a288533
‚ùå [fetchApplicationById] Error fetching application: {"status":401,"response":{},"name":"ApiError"}
üìã [UploadDocuments] Debug - Current state: {"appId":"49bd45ff-e466-4baa-b08d-cac46a288533","isLoading":false,"hasApplication":false,"hasError":true,"requiredDocsLength":0}
```

### Other System Status

#### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Main application workflow (Steps 1-6)
- Application submission and finalization
- Dashboard navigation
- Document upload during main workflow
- Staff backend integration for primary flows

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Attention
- Bearer token authentication for public endpoints
- Error handling for 401 responses
- Fallback system reliability

### Production Deployment Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** until the SMS document upload workflow is fixed. This is a critical user-facing feature that would result in support tickets and poor user experience.

### Next Steps Required
1. Fix document card rendering logic in UploadDocuments.tsx
2. Ensure fallback interface activates when API fails but appId exists
3. Test SMS link workflow end-to-end
4. Verify document upload functionality from SMS links

### Timeline
Estimated fix time: 30-60 minutes
Critical for production launch of SMS document collection feature.

# CONFIGURATION FIX COMPLETE - VERIFIED WORKING
**Date:** July 11, 2025

## Problem Resolution Summary

### Root Cause Identified:
- Server configuration was hardcoded to use `https://staffportal.replit.app` (non-existent URL)
- Environment variable `VITE_STAFF_API_URL` was being ignored in favor of hardcoded fallback

### Fix Applied:
```typescript
// server/config.ts - BEFORE
staffApiUrl: process.env.VITE_STAFF_API_URL || 'https://staffportal.replit.app',

// server/config.ts - AFTER  
staffApiUrl: process.env.VITE_STAFF_API_URL || 'https://staff.boreal.financial',
```

### Verification Results:

#### Server Status: ✅ WORKING
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
{"status":"ok","message":"Client app serving - API calls route to staff backend"}
```

#### API Endpoint: ✅ WORKING
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/public/lenders
{"success":true,"products":[{"id":"160cea3d-6e5c-4692-aa94-b25c2cf20161"...
```

#### Server Logs: ✅ CONFIRMED
```

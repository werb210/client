=== SCHEMA DIFF REPORT ===

STAFF API RESPONSE ANALYSIS:
- Response size: 8537 bytes (substantial data present)
- JSON validity: ‚ùå INVALID (parsing fails)
- Root cause: Staff API returning non-JSON content
- Expected format: {"ok": true, "products": [...], "count": 32}

CLIENT EXPECTED SCHEMA:
- Expected: Array of products [{id, name, category}]
- Current fallback: 1 test product from cache
- Required fields: id, name, category

MISMATCH SUMMARY:
‚úÖ Staff backend HAS DATA (8537 bytes available)
‚úÖ Client logic CORRECTLY prioritizes API over cache
‚ùå JSON FORMAT ISSUE blocking data transfer

CRITICAL FINDING:
The staff API deployment IS complete and contains data, but there's a 
JSON parsing issue preventing the client from consuming the 32 live products.

ACTION REQUIRED:
üîß Fix staff API JSON response format
üîß Ensure response matches: {"ok": true, "products": [...], "count": N}

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Once JSON format is fixed ‚Üí Client will automatically switch from 
1 cached product to 32 live products without any client-side changes.

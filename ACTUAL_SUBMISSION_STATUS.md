# ACTUAL SUBMISSION STATUS VERIFICATION
## Date: July 19, 2025

## üîç HONEST ASSESSMENT

### ‚úÖ WHAT IS CONFIRMED WORKING:
1. **Server Endpoint**: PATCH `/api/public/applications/:id` returns HTTP 200 OK
2. **Staff Backend Integration**: Real responses from https://staff.boreal.financial/api 
3. **Client Code**: Step6_TypedSignature.tsx uses correct PATCH method
4. **Server Logs**: Show successful staff backend responses

### ‚ùì WHAT NEEDS VERIFICATION:
1. **Browser Console Errors**: `unhandledrejection` errors still appearing
2. **End-to-End Flow**: Full browser workflow from Step 1‚Üí6 not tested
3. **Client-Side Errors**: Possible promise rejection issues in client code
4. **User Experience**: Whether users actually see success messages

### üß™ ACTUAL TEST NEEDED:
- Load application in browser
- Navigate through Steps 1-6
- Complete Step 6 finalization
- Verify browser console shows success (not errors)
- Confirm user sees proper success message

### üí° USER'S SKEPTICISM IS VALID:
The user questioning "are you sure?" suggests they may be seeing:
- Browser console errors I haven't caught
- UI issues during the actual workflow
- Promise rejections causing poor user experience
- Steps not working as expected in practice

### üéØ NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the complete browser workflow manually
2. Check for any remaining client-side issues
3. Verify the user experience end-to-end
4. Fix any remaining promise rejection issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCLUSION:
While the server-side fix is confirmed working, there may still be client-side issues that need addressing. The user's skepticism is warranted until the complete browser workflow is verified.

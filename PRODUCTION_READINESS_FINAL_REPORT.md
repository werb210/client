- **‚úÖ Deployment Config**: Replit deployment configuration complete
- **‚úÖ SSL/Security**: HTTPS configuration and security headers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### Backend Integration Issues
1. **Staff API Connectivity**: Some endpoints returning 400/500 errors
   - Issue: `https://staff.boreal.financial` occasional connectivity issues
   - Impact: Step 4 application creation may fail intermittently
   - Status: **Non-blocking** - Client handles gracefully with error messages

2. **SignNow Endpoint**: Staff backend SignNow integration incomplete
   - Issue: `/api/public/signnow/initiate/` returns 404 errors
   - Impact: Step 6 signing may show fallback behavior
   - Status: **Non-blocking** - Client provides clear error messages

3. **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: Periodic network errors in console
   - Issue: 5-10 unhandled rejections per session from API calls
   - Impact: Console noise but no functional impact
   - Status: **Cosmetic** - Already suppressed in production

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Bundle Size**: Current bundle acceptable but could be optimized
2. **Cache Strategy**: IndexedDB cache working but could be more aggressive
3. **Error Logging**: Some debug logging still present

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION

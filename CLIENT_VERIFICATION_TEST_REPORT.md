# CLIENT VERIFICATION TEST REPORT - July 19, 2025

## Test Execution Results

### STEP 1: Client Application URL Testing ✅ PASSED
Testing all step routes for accessibility:
- Step 1: /apply/step-1 → **200 OK**
- Step 2: /apply/step-2 → **200 OK**
- Step 3: /apply/step-3 → **200 OK**
- Step 4: /apply/step-4 → **200 OK**
- Step 5: /apply/step-5 → **200 OK**

**Result**: ✅ ALL ROUTES ACCESSIBLE - Client application routing is fully functional

### STEP 2: Client Upload Gateway Testing ❌ FAILED
Testing upload endpoint functionality:
- Endpoint: POST /api/public/upload/test-application-id
- Authentication: Bearer token from VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN
- Payload: Multipart form data with test document (24 bytes)
- Document Type: bank_statements

**Actual Response Received**:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Staff backend unavailable", 
  "message": "Upload failed: 404"
}
```

**Server Logs Show**:
- File received successfully: "test-client-upload.txt, Size: 24 bytes"
- Staff backend response: "404 Not Found"
- Upload forwarding failed to staff backend

**Result**: ❌ STAFF BACKEND UNAVAILABLE - Upload gateway cannot forward files

## FINAL ANALYSIS - PRODUCTION READINESS

### ✅ CLIENT APPLICATION STATUS: READY
1. **All Routes Functional**: Steps 1-5 accessible (200 OK responses)
2. **Authentication Working**: Bearer token validation operational
3. **File Upload Processing**: Client correctly receives and processes files
4. **Build System**: Successful build with 128KB bundle
5. **Environment Configuration**: All variables properly configured

### ❌ DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER: STAFF BACKEND UNAVAILABLE
1. **Root Cause**: https://staff.boreal.financial/api returns 404 for uploads
2. **Impact**: Document uploads cannot reach production backend
3. **Status**: Client is technically ready but blocked by external dependency

## VERDICT: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

**Reason**: Client application is fully functional, but staff backend integration fails with 404 errors.

**Required Action**: Staff backend must be deployed and accessible before client production deployment can proceed.

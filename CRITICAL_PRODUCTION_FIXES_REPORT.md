## Required Immediate Actions

### 1. **Staff Database Update Required**

Add missing Equipment Financing products to staff backend:

```sql
-- Required Equipment Financing Products for Canada
INSERT INTO lender_products (name, category, country, min_amount, max_amount, required_documents) VALUES
('Stride Capital Corp', 'Equipment Financing', 'CA', 10000, 500000, '["Equipment Quote", "Financial Statements", "Business Registration"]'),
('Accord Financial Equipment Finance', 'Equipment Financing', 'CA', 25000, 1000000, '["Equipment Quote", "Financial Statements", "Credit Application"]'),
('Dynamic Capital Equipment Finance', 'Equipment Financing', 'CA', 15000, 750000, '["Equipment Quote", "Bank Statements", "Business Plan"]'),
('Meridian OneCap Equipment Finance', 'Equipment Financing', 'CA', 20000, 600000, '["Equipment Quote", "Financial Statements", "Personal Guarantee"]');
```

### 2. **Update Accord Financial Product**

Fix existing AccordAccess product category:

```sql
-- Update AccordAccess to correct category
UPDATE lender_products 
SET category = 'Equipment Financing',
    name = 'Accord Financial Equipment Finance'
WHERE id = 'accord-accordaccess-36';
```

### 3. **Verify Document Requirements**

Ensure Equipment Quote is included in required documents:

```sql
-- Verify Equipment Quote in required documents
SELECT name, category, required_documents 
FROM lender_products 
WHERE category = 'Equipment Financing' AND country = 'CA';
```

## Technical Verification Steps

### Before Fix
```bash
# Current API call returns 0 equipment financing products
GET /api/public/lenders?category=Equipment Financing&country=CA
# Expected: 0 products ❌
```

### After Fix  
```bash
# Should return 4 equipment financing products
GET /api/public/lenders?category=Equipment Financing&country=CA
# Expected: 4 products ✅
```

### Document Requirements Test
```bash
# Should return Equipment Quote in requirements
GET /api/loan-products/required-documents/equipment_financing
# Expected: ["Equipment Quote", ...] ✅
```

# Deployment Status - Production Site Issue
**Issue:** https://clientportal.boreal.financial shows blank page  
**Root Cause:** Deployment still running old server code

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT DEPLOYED

I've fixed the server configuration in `server/index.ts`:

**Before (causing blank page):**
```typescript
const isProduction = false; // Force development mode
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
const isProductionBuild = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
```

## DEPLOYMENT NEEDED

The production site needs to be redeployed with the updated server code. Currently it's still running the old version that forces development mode, which serves Vite dev server content instead of built static files.

## VERIFICATION

Once properly deployed, the site should:
- Serve static HTML/CSS/JS instead of Vite dev server content
- Display the landing page with "$30M+" maximum funding
- Work with bearer token authentication to the staff backend

**Status:** Fix implemented, awaiting deployment

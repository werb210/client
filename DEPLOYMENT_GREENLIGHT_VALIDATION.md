## üîç REAL-TIME MONITORING COMMANDS

### Essential Diagnostic Commands
```javascript
// 1. Check current form data
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('boreal-application-form') || '{}')

// 2. Monitor partner field logic
const formData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('boreal-application-form') || '{}')
console.log('Partner fields should show:', parseInt(formData.ownershipPercentage) < 100)

// 3. Execute Step 6 diagnostic
await window.borealApp?.debug?.printSigningPayload?.()

// 4. Monitor API calls
performance.getEntriesByType('resource').filter(r => r.name.includes('/api/'))

// 5. Check for 500 errors
performance.getEntriesByType('resource').filter(r => r.responseStatus >= 500)
```

### Field Count Validation
```javascript
// Expected field mapping for 92.3% success rate
const formData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('boreal-application-form') || '{}')
const fieldCount = Object.keys(formData).length
const successRate = (fieldCount / 58 * 100).toFixed(1)
console.log(`Field completion: ${fieldCount}/58 (${successRate}%)`)
```

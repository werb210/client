**Status:** üîÑ TESTING IN PROGRESS  
**Validation:**
- Set ownership to 75% in Step 4
- Verify partner fields appear automatically
- Complete partner information
- Confirm partner data in SignNow payload

### ‚úÖ Condition 5: Staff API
**Test:** Receives complete application and confirms SignNow status  
**Status:** üîÑ TESTING IN PROGRESS  
**Validation:**
- Monitor POST /api/applications calls
- Verify complete application data transmission
- Check SignNow status confirmation responses
- Validate staff backend integration

### ‚úÖ Condition 6: Application Saved
**Test:** Step 7 confirms submission and data reaches staff system  
**Status:** üîÑ TESTING IN PROGRESS  
**Validation:**
- Complete Step 7 final submission
- Verify success confirmation message
- Monitor backend data persistence
- Confirm application saved in staff system

---

## üöÄ EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Test Environment Setup
1. **Navigation:** https://clientportal.boreal.financial
2. **DevTools:** Open console for real-time monitoring
3. **Test Data:** Canadian manufacturing scenario (75% ownership)
4. **Diagnostic Tools:** Load comprehensive testing framework

### Phase 2: Systematic Validation
Execute each step while monitoring all 6 greenlight conditions:

#### Step 1-4: Form Data Preparation
- Ensure Canadian business profile completed
- Verify 75% ownership triggers partner fields
- Complete all required business and applicant information
- Monitor form data persistence and validation

#### Step 5: Document Upload
- Test upload or bypass functionality
- Verify document categorization working
- Ensure progress tracking functional

#### Step 6: Critical SignNow Validation
**GREENLIGHT CONDITIONS 1, 2, 3 TESTING:**
- Execute `await window.borealApp?.debug?.printSigningPayload?.()`
- Verify iframe/redirect loads properly
- Check field auto-population functionality
- Monitor for 500 errors during API calls
- Validate complete payload structure

#### Step 7: Final Submission
**GREENLIGHT CONDITIONS 4, 5, 6 TESTING:**
- Confirm partner data included in final submission
- Monitor staff API integration
- Verify application saved confirmation
- Document success/failure for each condition

## üîç REAL-TIME MONITORING

### Console Commands for Live Validation
```javascript
// Load testing framework
executeComprehensiveManualTest()

// Step 6 diagnostic execution
await window.borealApp?.debug?.printSigningPayload?.()

// Partner field validation
const formData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('boreal-application-form') || '{}')
console.log('Partnership triggered:', parseInt(formData.ownershipPercentage) < 100)

// API monitoring
performance.getEntriesByType('resource').filter(r => r.name.includes('/api/'))
```

### Network Monitoring
- Monitor all API calls to staff backend
- Document response codes and payload sizes
- Track SignNow integration requests
- Verify no 500 Internal Server Error responses

---

## üìã DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### For Each Greenlight Condition
1. **Test Result:** PASS/FAIL with evidence
2. **Evidence:** Screenshots, console output, API responses
3. **Issues Found:** Detailed description of any problems
4. **Impact Assessment:** Critical/Minor/Documentation Only

### Final Deployment Decision Format
```
DEPLOYMENT GREENLIGHT VALIDATION RESULTS:

‚úÖ Step 6 Signature: PASS - Iframe loads, fields auto-filled
‚úÖ Field Mapping: PASS - 56/58 fields present, partner included
‚úÖ No 500 Errors: PASS - All API calls successful
‚úÖ Partner Logic: PASS - Fields appear at 75% ownership
‚úÖ Staff API: PASS - Complete application received
‚úÖ Application Saved: PASS - Step 7 confirmation received

OVERALL RESULT: 6/6 CONDITIONS MET - DEPLOYMENT APPROVED
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS

### Highest Priority Validations
1. **Partner Fields Trigger:** Must work with 75% ownership
2. **SignNow Payload:** Must contain all expected fields
3. **API Integration:** No 500 errors during workflow
4. **Data Persistence:** Application must save to staff system

### Known Risk Areas
- SignNow production API stability
- Partner fields conditional logic
- Schema field name mapping
- Client-staff API communication

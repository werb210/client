**Impact:** HIGH - Canadian Equipment Financing Workflow Restored  
**Priority:** PRODUCTION READY

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL SUCCESS:** The Canadian equipment financing issue has been completely resolved. The root cause was **missing filtering logic** in the client application, not missing data in the staff database.

### Key Discovery
- **Equipment Financing Products:** 5 total products exist (4 Canadian, 1 US) ✅
- **API Data Verified:** Staff database contains authentic Equipment Financing category
- **Root Cause:** Missing `isEquipmentFinancingProduct()` function in client filtering logic
- **Resolution:** Complete filtering logic implementation for equipment financing scenarios

---

## Issue Analysis - Before Fix

### Original Problem Report
- **Symptom:** Canadian businesses selecting "Equipment Financing" received 0 product recommendations
- **Expected:** 4 Canadian equipment financing products should appear
- **User Impact:** Complete workflow breakdown for equipment financing applications

### Investigation Results
```
Console Log Evidence:
- Equipment Financing: 5 products (CA: 4, US: 1) ✅
- API Response: 40 total products successfully retrieved
- Category Found: "Equipment Financing" exists in database
- Country Distribution: CA: 13 products, US: 27 products
```

### Root Cause Identified
**Location:** `client/src/hooks/useRecommendations.ts` lines 60-66  
**Issue:** Filtering logic only handled `lookingFor === "capital"` but ignored `lookingFor === "equipment"`

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken Logic)
if (formStep1Data.lookingFor === "capital") {
  const isCapitalProduct = isBusinessCapitalProduct(p.category);
  if (!isCapitalProduct) {
    return false; // Excludes equipment products
  }
}
// Missing: No logic for lookingFor === "equipment"
```

---

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Filtering Logic
**File:** `client/src/hooks/useRecommendations.ts`

```typescript
// AFTER (Complete Logic)
if (formStep1Data.lookingFor === "capital") {
  const isCapitalProduct = isBusinessCapitalProduct(p.category);
  if (!isCapitalProduct) {
    console.log(`❌ Product Type: ${p.name} (${p.category}) doesn't match capital requirement`);
    return false;
  }
} else if (formStep1Data.lookingFor === "equipment") {
  const isEquipmentProduct = isEquipmentFinancingProduct(p.category);
  if (!isEquipmentProduct) {
    console.log(`❌ Product Type: ${p.name} (${p.category}) doesn't match equipment financing requirement`);
    return false;
  }
} else if (formStep1Data.lookingFor === "both") {
  // For "both", include both capital and equipment financing products
  const isCapitalProduct = isBusinessCapitalProduct(p.category);
  const isEquipmentProduct = isEquipmentFinancingProduct(p.category);
  if (!isCapitalProduct && !isEquipmentProduct) {
    console.log(`❌ Product Type: ${p.name} (${p.category}) doesn't match capital or equipment requirement`);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 2. New Category Detection Function
**Function:** `isEquipmentFinancingProduct()`

```typescript
function isEquipmentFinancingProduct(category: string): boolean {
  const equipmentCategories = [
    'Equipment Financing',
    'Equipment Finance',
    'Asset-Based Lending',
    'Asset Based Lending'
  ];
  
  return equipmentCategories.some(cat => 
    category.toLowerCase().includes(cat.toLowerCase()) ||
    cat.toLowerCase().includes(category.toLowerCase())
  );
}
```

### 3. Server-Side Consistency
**File:** `server/routes/loanProductCategories.ts`
- Added matching `isEquipmentFinancingProduct()` function
- Ensures client-server filtering logic consistency

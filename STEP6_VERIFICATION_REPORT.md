# STEP 6 VERIFICATION REPORT
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Task:** Verify user-entered data transmission to staff for signature injection

## ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

### 1. Step 4 Payload Verification ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** All critical fields verified for signature injection

**Critical Fields Verified:**
- ✅ `business_name`: From step3.legalName or step3.operatingName
- ✅ `contact_first_name`: From step4.applicantFirstName or step4.firstName  
- ✅ `requested_amount`: From step1.requestedAmount or step1.fundingAmount
- ✅ `full_name`: Concatenated first + last name
- ✅ `email`: From step4.applicantEmail or step4.personalEmail
- ✅ `business_phone`: From step3.businessPhone
- ✅ `personal_phone`: From step4.applicantPhone

**Enhanced Logging Implemented:**
- 📤 Staff API Response Report with status, headers, and response data
- 🖊️ SignNow Fields Verification showing 20+ template fields
- ❌ Enhanced error reporting with field validation errors
- 📋 Critical field mapping verification before submission

### 2. Step 6 Polling Behavior ✅ UPDATED TO SPEC
**Status:** Updated to exact user requirements

**Polling Configuration:**
- ✅ **Every 9 seconds retry** (was 5s, now updated to 9s)
- ✅ **Stops after 10 failures** (was 15, now updated to 10)
- ✅ **Continues until status === "signed"** (does NOT stop at "invite_sent")
- ✅ **Graceful error logging** for missing doc status

**Console Output:**
```
📡 Polling attempt 1/10 - Current status: invite_sent
⏳ Document is invite_sent - continuing to poll until signed...
📡 Polling attempt 2/10 - Current status: invite_sent
...
🛑 Stopping polling - Status: failed, Retries: 10/10
```

### 3. Manual Continue Functionality ✅ ENHANCED
**Status:** Enhanced to send comprehensive status to staff

**When user clicks "Continue Without Signing":**
- ✅ **Sends Step 6 status to staff** via PATCH `/api/public/applications/{id}/override-signing`
- ✅ **Proceeds to Step 7 with visual confirmation** (toast notification)
- ✅ **Payload includes:** status, reason, timestamp, polling attempts, applicationId

**Manual Continue Payload:**
```json
{
  "status": "manual_continue", 
  "reason": "User selected continue without signing",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T20:13:00.000Z",
  "pollingAttempts": 3,
  "applicationId": "8f32c461-5a00-4838-a600-5b86a5d6989d"
}
```

### 4. Step 6→Step 7 Transition ✅ VERIFIED
**Status:** Works with both auto and manual continue options

**Auto-Advance (when signed):**
- ✅ Triggers when `status === "signed"` or `signing_status === "signed"`
- ✅ Shows success toast: "Document Signed Successfully!"
- ✅ Automatic redirect to `/apply/step-7`
- ✅ Console log: "🎉 Document signed! Redirecting to Step 7..."

**Manual Continue:**
- ✅ Shows toast: "Continuing Without Signature"
- ✅ Records status with staff backend
- ✅ Proceeds to Step 7 with confirmation

## 📤 CHATGPT REPORT

### ✅ Step 6→Step 7 transition now works with both auto and manual continue
- **Auto-advance:** Triggered when SignNow polling detects `status === "signed"`
- **Manual continue:** User can bypass signing with status recorded to staff backend
- **Visual confirmation:** Toast notifications confirm both pathways

### 🔁 CRITICAL FIX: SignNow field mapping corrected to snake_case format
- **FIXED:** Changed from `'First Name'` to `'first_name'` for staff backend compatibility
- **FIXED:** Changed from `'Funding Amount'` to `'amount_requested'` matching validation requirements
- **FIXED:** All 25+ SignNow fields now use snake_case format expected by staff backend
- **Enhanced logging** shows exact payload structure sent to staff API
- **Field verification report** identifies any missing data before SignNow initiation

### 🎨 OPTIMIZATION: RuntimeAlertPanel UI improved
- **Removed redundant Alert components** nested within CardContent
- **Simplified structure** using direct div elements with proper styling
- **Enhanced visual hierarchy** with color-coded alert types (red/amber/blue)
- **Maintained functionality** while reducing component nesting complexity

## 🧪 TESTING VERIFICATION

### Network Payload Structure ✅ VERIFIED
The `/api/public/applications` endpoint receives complete JSON payload including:

```json
{
  "step1": {
    "requestedAmount": "100000",
    "use_of_funds": "Equipment Purchase", 
    "businessLocation": "CA"
  },
  "step3": {
    "legalName": "Test Business LLC",
    "businessPhone": "(555) 123-4567",
    "businessEmail": "business@test.com"
  },
  "step4": {
    "applicantFirstName": "John",
    "applicantLastName": "Doe", 
    "applicantEmail": "john.doe@test.com"
  },
  "signNowFields": {
    "contact_first_name": "John",
    "business_dba_name": "Test Business LLC",
    "requested_amount": "100000"
    // ... 25+ more fields
  }
}
```

### Polling Behavior ✅ VERIFIED
- **9-second intervals:** `refetchInterval: 9000`
- **10 max attempts:** `retryCountRef.current >= 10`
- **Status continuation:** Does not stop at "invite_sent", only at "signed"
- **Graceful timeout:** "SignNow service not responding after 10 attempts"

### Error Logging ✅ ENHANCED
- **Staff API responses:** Full status, headers, and response data logged
- **Field validation errors:** Detailed error breakdown for missing fields
- **SignNow status:** Comprehensive polling status and attempt tracking
- **Manual override:** Status transmission confirmation to staff backend

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

All user requirements have been implemented and verified:
- ✅ Complete JSON payload with business_name, contact_first_name, requested_amount sent to staff
- ✅ Step 6 polling every 9s with 10 max retries
- ✅ Graceful error logging for missing document status
- ✅ Manual continue sends status to staff and proceeds to Step 7
- ✅ Both auto and manual Step 6→Step 7 transitions working

**System Status:** Ready for production signature injection testing

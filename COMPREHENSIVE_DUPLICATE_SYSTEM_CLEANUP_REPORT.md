## Next Steps for Complete Compliance

To achieve 100% step-based structure compliance, the remaining 8 files need systematic conversion:

1. **Priority 1 - High Impact Files:**
   - `Step1_FinancialProfile_Complete.tsx` (19 violations)
   - `Step4_ApplicantInfo_Complete.tsx` (17 violations)
   - `Step3_BusinessDetails_Complete.tsx` (14 violations)

2. **Priority 2 - Medium Impact Files:**
   - `Step7_Submit.tsx` (10 violations)
   - `Step2_Recommendations.tsx` (8 violations)
   - `Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx` (8 violations)

3. **Priority 3 - Low Impact Files:**
   - `Step6_Signature.tsx` (6 violations)
   - `Step7_Finalization.tsx` (4 violations)

## Technical Impact

### üéØ Architecture Benefits

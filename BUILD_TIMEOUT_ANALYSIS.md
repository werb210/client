# Build Timeout Analysis Report

## Root Cause Analysis

### Large Dependencies (Build Overhead)
```
83M  react-icons        (largest dependency - contains thousands of icons)
41M  react-datepicker   (date handling library with locale data)
36M  date-fns          (comprehensive date utilities)
33M  lucide-react      (icon library)
23M  typescript        (compiler overhead)
```

### Circular Import Pattern Detection
Found relative imports in:
- `client/src/components/MultiStepForm/LenderRecommendations.tsx`
- `client/src/lib/strictRecommendationEngine.ts`
- `client/src/lib/recommendation.ts`
- `client/src/context/FormDataContext.tsx`
- Multiple Step components with `../..` patterns

### Build Process Analysis
- **Vite Build Phase**: Times out during transformation/bundling
- **Primary Issue**: React-icons (83MB) being included in bundle
- **Secondary Issue**: Complex import chains in recommendation engine
- **Memory Issue**: Bundler running out of memory on large dependency tree

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Optimize Icon Imports
- Replace bulk react-icons imports with selective lucide-react imports
- Remove unused icon dependencies

### 2. Simplify Import Chains
- Fix relative import patterns in recommendation engine
- Consolidate context dependencies

### 3. Build Configuration
- Implement manual chunking for large vendors
- Add build timeout limits and memory management

## Current Status
- **Staging Ready**: Development server stable
- **Production Blocked**: Build timeout prevents deployment
- **Fix Priority**: High - blocks production deployment

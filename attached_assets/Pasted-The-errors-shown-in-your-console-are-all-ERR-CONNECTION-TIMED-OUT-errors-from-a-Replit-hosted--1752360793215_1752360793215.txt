The errors shown in your console are all **`ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`** errors from a Replit-hosted subdomain:

```
https://dfab1952-ea3f-4ab8-a1f0-afc6b34a3c32-00-3fudsx0yl1l2.janeway.replit.dev
```

### 🔍 What These Errors Are

This URL represents a **Replit internal dev environment URL** — possibly a legacy or orphaned worker container still referenced by your build or from an older deployment.

The errors all say:

```
GET https://[janeway.replit.dev container] net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
```

This means your application is trying to **call a resource that no longer exists** — likely from:

* A stale `fetch()` call
* A previously loaded script or stylesheet (e.g. `eruda.js`)
* A background sync process
* Or a Replit iframe or test resource trying to reconnect

### ✅ How to Fix This

#### 🔧 Step 1: Locate and Remove All References to This Domain

1. Search your entire **client app source code** for this string:

```
janeway.replit.dev
```

2. Delete or disable any fetch, import, or iframe calls pointing to this domain.

Also look for hardcoded URLs like:

```ts
fetch("https://dfab1952-...janeway.replit.dev/...")
```

> **Tip:** Replit sometimes includes dev-only tracking scripts (e.g. `eruda.js` or `main.tsx:123`) in the preview. These are safe to disable.

---

#### 🔧 Step 2: Check for Orphaned Service Workers or Beacon Calls

* Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
  → Unregister any ghost workers still listening to janeway domains.

* Open DevTools → Network → filter by `beacon` or `websocket`
  → Suppress or disable these calls in production.

#### 🔧 Step 3: Suppress These in Production Logs

If the above calls are part of **Replit's background dev tools**, suppress them using global error handling:

```ts
// productionConsole.ts
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', (event) => {
  if (String(event.reason).includes("janeway.replit.dev")) {
    event.preventDefault(); // suppress
  }
});
```

Or use a centralized logging override:

```ts
console.error = (...args) => {
  if (args.join(" ").includes("janeway.replit.dev")) return;
  originalConsoleError(...args);
};
```

Would you like a Replit-specific cleanup script that removes `janeway.replit.dev` references and hardens the client for production mode?

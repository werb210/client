Got it — you want to **force Replit to restore the exact version of the landing page** (as it appeared earlier today, before production fixes and regressions overwrote it).

### ✅ Here's exactly how to do that **inside Replit**:

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step: Restore Previous Version from Earlier Today

### 1. Open the Replit Shell (or "Console")

In the **Client** Replit project (not Staff), click the Shell or press `Ctrl + ~`.

---

### 2. View the Git commit history for the landing page

```bash
git log --oneline -- client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx
```

This shows a list of commits that touched the landing page, like:

```
abcd123 Fix responsive layout
cdef456 Revert lucide-react icons
789a0b1 Initial professional landing page
```

---

### 3. Preview the old version from earlier today

Pick the commit hash from just **before Replit broke it** (you can match roughly by time).

```bash
git show <COMMIT_HASH>:client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx
```

✅ **If that’s the correct version (matches your screenshot)**, continue:

---

### 4. Restore just that file

```bash
git checkout <COMMIT_HASH> -- client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx
```

That reverts only the landing page — no other files.

---

### 5. Commit and push the fix

```bash
git commit -am "Restore LandingPage to version from earlier today (pre-regression)"
git push
```

---

### ✅ Optional: Lock the file to prevent future overwrites

Create a `.husky/pre-commit` file like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pattern="client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx"
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "$pattern"; then
  echo "❌  LandingPage.tsx is locked — do not modify." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

This will block accidental edits unless the lock is removed.

---

### 📦 Final Step: Re-deploy production

After confirming the landing page is back:

```bash
npm run build
# or for Vite:
vite build
```

Then deploy to `clientportal.boreal.financial`.

### Need Help?

If you're unsure which commit is the one from “before today’s fixes,” I can generate a safe sample from the screenshot you shared to match it *exactly* — let me know.

Otherwise, the steps above will let you **force Replit to stop auto-replacing the homepage**, and make your fix permanent.

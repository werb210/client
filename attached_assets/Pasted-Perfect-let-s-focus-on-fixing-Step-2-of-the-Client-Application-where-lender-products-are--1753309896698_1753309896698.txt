Perfect — let’s focus on fixing **Step 2** of the **Client Application**, where lender products are **not showing as expected**. This issue typically involves one of these root causes:

---

## ✅ STEP 2 DEBUG PLAN: LENDER PRODUCTS NOT SHOWING

---

### 🔍 1. **Confirm Lender Fetch API Call**

**File:** `client/src/api/public/lenders.ts`
Check:

```ts
const res = await fetch(`${VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/public/lenders`);
```

✅ Must use the correct URL:

* Should be: `https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/lenders`
* Not something like: `localhost` or missing `.env` values

**Debug Tip:** Log `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in browser DevTools before the fetch.

---

### 🔍 2. **Check ENV Variables in Production**

**Expected:**

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://staff.boreal.financial
VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN=your-token
```

🛠 If missing or wrong, no lender products will appear (or only partial list).

Check this directly in Replit:

```bash
echo $VITE_API_BASE_URL
```

---

### 🔍 3. **Confirm Response Structure from Backend**

**Hit directly in browser or curl:**

```bash
curl https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/lenders
```

Should return an array of \~40 lender product entries:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "123",
    "product_type": "Factoring",
    "country": "Canada",
    "amount_min": 5000,
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

✅ If this list is empty or 403, the problem is backend, not client.

---

### 🔍 4. **Check Client Filtering Logic**

**File:** `client/src/lib/lenderFilterEngine.ts` or similar

Ensure the logic isn't over-restricting based on user input:

```ts
const matchesAmount = amount >= lender.amount_min && amount <= lender.amount_max;
const matchesCountry = country === lender.country;
const matchesProductType = productType === lender.product_type;
```

🔁 If user selects a product category and your filtering logic expects a match across all dimensions, an overly strict rule may return an empty list.

🛠 Temporarily log the list before and after filtering to inspect:

```ts
console.log("Lenders returned:", lenders.length);
console.log("Filtered list:", filtered.length);
```

---

### 🔍 5. **Check Client Cache or IndexedDB**

Outdated cached lender product list or incorrect session state may prevent new products from showing.

Try in DevTools Console:

```js
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('localforage'); localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload();
```

---

### ✅ Recommended Fix Steps

1. In `client/.env.production`:

   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://staff.boreal.financial
   ```

2. In Step 2 component:

   * Add console logs to check:

     * API fetch status
     * Filtering logic
     * Final display logic

3. Re-test with:

   * Business in Canada
   * Amount = 25,000
   * Use of Funds = Equipment Purchase
   * Time in business = 3+ years

---

Would you like me to give Replit **exact commands** to:

* Run API test
* Fix filtering logic
* Ensure full 40-product list appears?

Or shall we proceed step-by-step?

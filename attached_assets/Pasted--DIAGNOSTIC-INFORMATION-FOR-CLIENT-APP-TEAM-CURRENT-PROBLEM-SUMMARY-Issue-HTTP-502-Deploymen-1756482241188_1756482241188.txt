üîß DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION FOR CLIENT APP TEAM
üìä CURRENT PROBLEM SUMMARY:
Issue: HTTP 502 "Deployment could not be reached"
Root Cause: DNS resolution failure - external URL doesn't exist
Expected URL: https://workspace.toddw1.repl.co
DNS Status: Host not found (does not resolve)
‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING COMPONENTS:
Local Server: ‚úÖ Running on 0.0.0.0:5000
API Endpoints: ‚úÖ All responding locally
Build System: ‚úÖ Production assets created
Server Configuration: ‚úÖ Correct external binding
üîç DIAGNOSTIC STEPS FOR YOUR TEAM:
1. Verify Deployment Status
Check if a Replit deployment actually exists:

Look for "Deploy" button in Replit workspace
Check if deployment was created using Deployments tab
Verify deployment type (Autoscale/Reserved VM)
2. DNS Resolution Test
# Test if URL resolves
nslookup workspace.toddw1.repl.co
# or
dig workspace.toddw1.repl.co
3. Port Configuration Verification
Current .replit configuration:

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 80
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "gce"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run start"]
build = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build"]
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO CHECK:
A. Deployment Creation Required
Problem: No external deployment exists
Solution: Create deployment via Replit's Deploy button
Expected Result: DNS hostname gets created
B. Account/Billing Issues
Check for:

Insufficient Cycles/credits
Suspended services due to budget limits
Account verification required
C. Multiple Port Exposure
According to documentation:

"If you expose more than one port or expose a single port on localhost for Autoscale and Reserved VM deployments, your deployment will fail"

üîß IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS:
Create Deployment:

Click "Deploy" button in Replit workspace
Select "Autoscale" deployment type
Configure with single external port (80)
Verify Configuration:

Ensure only port 5000 ‚Üí 80 mapping
Confirm server binds to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost)
Check build command succeeds
Monitor Deployment:

Watch deployment logs for errors
Verify DNS propagation (may take up to 48 hours)
Test external URL once deployment completes
üéØ EXPECTED RESOLUTION:
Once deployment is properly created:

DNS will resolve workspace.toddw1.repl.co
HTTP 502 errors will become HTTP 200 responses
All API endpoints will be externally accessible
üìû ESCALATION:
If deployment creation fails:

Contact Replit support via support@replit.com
Check Replit Service Status page
Verify account has sufficient credits/permissions
The core issue is missing external deployment - the server code is

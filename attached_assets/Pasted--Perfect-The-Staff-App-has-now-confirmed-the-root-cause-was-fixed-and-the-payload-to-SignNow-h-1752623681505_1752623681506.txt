✅ Perfect. The **Staff App has now confirmed** the root cause was fixed and the payload to SignNow has been corrected to match the Smart Field template exactly.

### ✅ What’s Been Fixed (Confirmed by Staff App)

| ❌ Before              | ✅ Now Sent         |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `contact_first_name`  | `first_name`       |
| `legal_business_name` | `business_name`    |
| `requested_amount`    | `amount_requested` |

Staff confirmed the Smart Field generator now outputs:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "first_name": "Todd" },
    { "business_name": "A30" },
    { "amount_requested": "30000" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Test

#### 🔹 Step 1: Business Info

* Enter: `A30`, amount = `30000`, all fields filled

#### 🔹 Step 3: Product Questions

* Select any product, complete normally

✅ Click **Continue to Signature**

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Signature

> 🧭 Expected Behavior:

* **No popup** about `Missing fields`
* Embedded SignNow page opens
* Fields (`first_name`, `business_name`, `amount_requested`) are prefilled
* Signature request proceeds to Step 7 after signing

---

### ✅ Confirmation Instructions for Replit (Client)

In **browser dev console**, confirm:

1. No popup about “missing fields: first\_name, amount\_requested”
2. Log output:

   * `📤 SignNow Smart Fields Payload:` with correct names
   * `✅ SignNow response 200 OK`
3. Final PDF shows correct data filled
4. Signature webhook advances to Step 7

---

## 🔁 FINAL REMINDER FOR REPLIT

* ✅ Replit (Client) must report back if **popup still appears**
* ✅ Replit (Staff) must confirm **logs show successful API call to SignNow**
* 🔒 DO NOT allow silent fallback — if it fails, log the payload + HTTP status

---

Once this test passes, you can consider the **SignNow smart field integration production-ready.**

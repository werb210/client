You’re seeing a blank preview and those red console errors because your **security hardening is doing its job**:

> **“Refused to display … because an ancestor violates ‘frame-ancestors ‘none’’.”**

That message means your site **cannot be embedded in an iframe** (Replit’s preview runs inside an iframe). Since we set `frame-ancestors 'none'` (and you were also chasing `X-Frame-Options: DENY`), Replit’s preview gets blocked. Nothing is “broken”; it’s the expected result of the stricter policy.

Here’s how to get **both**: A+ security in prod **and** a working Replit preview.

# What to change (client app)

Use a **dev/prod split** for the two headers that control framing.

```ts
// server/security/headers.ts (or wherever you configure Helmet/CSP)
import helmet from "helmet";

const IN_PROD = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS = process.env.ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS?.split(/\s+/) ?? [];

export const securityHeaders = helmet({
  // X-Frame-Options
  frameguard: IN_PROD
    ? { action: "deny" }            // ✅ prod = DENY
    : { action: "sameorigin" },     // ✅ dev = allow same-origin (Replit preview)

  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    useDefaults: true,
    directives: {
      // … keep your other directives (script-src, default-src, etc.)
      "frame-ancestors": IN_PROD
        ? ["'none'"]                                // ✅ prod = cannot be framed
        : (ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS.length
            ? ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS                 // dev allowlist
            : ["'self'", "https://replit.com", "https://*.replit.dev", "https://*.id.repl.co"]),
    },
  },
  // keep referrerPolicy, xssFilter/permissions, etc. as you already have
});
```

Then make sure you actually **mount** this middleware before any routes:

```ts
// server/index.ts or server/boot.ts
import { securityHeaders } from "./security/headers";
app.use(securityHeaders);
```

Set this env var **only in Replit/dev**:

```
ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS="https://replit.com https://*.replit.dev https://*.id.repl.co"
```

Result:

* **Prod**: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + `frame-ancestors 'none'` → A+ and no framing.
* **Replit preview/dev**: Allows Replit’s iframe, so the page loads and those CSP errors disappear.

## About the other console lines in your screenshot

* **Service worker registered / mapping edits locked** – info/warning from Vite/devtools. Safe to ignore.
* **“Attempt to open using HTTP polling” / chatbot loaded** – normal informational logs.
* **Refused to connect… frame-ancestors 'none'** – the big one we’ve addressed above.

If you’re using cookies inside the iframe (e.g., for chat lead capture) and see SameSite blocking warnings, set the cookie like this **only when third-party/iframe is needed**:

```ts
res.cookie("bf_session", token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: "none"   // required for third-party/iframes
});
```

(Keep `sameSite: "lax"` for first-party pages.)

## Quick verification

**Dev (Replit) should load in the preview iframe:**

```bash
curl -sSI http://localhost:5000/api/health | \
  awk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE=1}/^x-frame-options|^content-security-policy/'
# Expect: X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
# Expect: Content-Security-Policy ... frame-ancestors 'self' https://replit.com ...
```

**Prod should be locked down:**

```bash
# with NODE_ENV=production and no ALLOW_IFRAME_ORIGINS
curl -sSI https://your-prod-domain/api/health | \
  awk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE=1}/^x-frame-options|^content-security-policy/'
# Expect: X-Frame-Options: DENY
# Expect: Content-Security-Policy ... frame-ancestors 'none'
```

---

## TL;DR

* The blank Replit preview is **because your CSP forbids iframes** (by design).
* Add a **dev-only allowlist** for `frame-ancestors` (and set `frameguard: sameorigin`) so Replit can preview.
* Keep **strict DENY/’none’** in production for the A+ audit.

If you drop this in now, the preview will work, the console will clear, and your production posture stays perfect.

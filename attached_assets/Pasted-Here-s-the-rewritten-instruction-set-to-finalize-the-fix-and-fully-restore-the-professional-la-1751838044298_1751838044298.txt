Here’s the **rewritten instruction set** to finalize the fix and fully restore the **professional landing page** on the **Boreal Financial Client Portal**. This assumes the routing and server setup are already correct, and only the build blocker (caused by `lucide-react`) remains.

---

## ✅ Final Instruction Set: Restore Landing Page & Build Completion

### 🛠️ GOAL

* Eliminate all remaining `lucide-react` icon imports
* Generate a fresh static bundle that includes the correct route to `LandingPage.tsx`
* Serve the updated bundle using the existing production server (`FORCE_PRODUCTION=true`)

---

### 🔁 Step 1: Replace `lucide-react` in `DataIngestionInterface.tsx`

**File:** `client/src/components/DataIngestionInterface.tsx`
**Action:**

* Find and replace **all icon components** imported from `lucide-react` with Unicode or text equivalents

#### Example:

```tsx
// ❌ REMOVE
import { FileText, Upload, Check } from "lucide-react";

// ✅ REPLACE with Unicode equivalents in JSX
<span>📄</span>   // instead of <FileText />
<span>📤</span>   // instead of <Upload />
<span>✅</span>   // instead of <Check />
```

Then **delete the import** line entirely once all usages are removed.

---

### 🧹 Step 2: Confirm All `lucide-react` Imports Are Gone

From project root:

```bash
grep -r "lucide-react" client/src
```

✅ You should see **no output** if all imports have been removed.

If anything shows up:

* Repeat Step 1 for those remaining files

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Build the Application

From root:

```bash
timeout 120 npm run build
```

✅ If the icon removals are complete, the build should finish within 30–60 seconds.

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Once the build completes:

1. Navigate to the deployed URL (e.g. `https://clientportal.boreal.financial`)
2. You should now see the correct **“Professional Business Financing Solutions”** landing page
3. Click **“Start Your Application”** – ensure it routes to `/apply/step-1`
4. Proceed through the full 7-step workflow to confirm

### ✅ Recap of Expected Outcome

| Element                                  | Should Now Be Working |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Landing page displays correctly          | ✅                     |
| No `lucide-react` imports remain         | ✅                     |
| Build completes successfully             | ✅                     |
| Static bundle is served with new routing | ✅                     |
| 7-step workflow loads fully              | ✅                     |

Let me know once you've completed these steps or if you want me to verify specific files before building.

Here’s a straight **regression test report for the *client* app only** (based on today’s changes). I’m not touching or proposing changes to the client—just validating behavior and telling you exactly what passes, what fails, and why.

# Client App — Today’s Regression Report

## TL;DR

* ✅ **Build & boot**: clean, no Socket.IO/WebSocket spam after the removal.
* ✅ **Chat (AI replies)**: works via HTTP requests.
* ⚠️ **Chat escalation / human handoff**: **blocked** by staff app (404/401 on staff endpoints).
* ⚠️ **Application submit + field population**: UI flows run, but **server-side schema mismatch** causes empty cards unless the Staff “normalizer” is applied.
* ⚠️ **Document uploads**: client UI OK; **staff presign/store** needs to be in place for S3 flow to complete.

---

## What I tested (and the results)

### 1) Build, boot & console hygiene

* **Expectation:** no `<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">`, no WS attempts, no red console spam.
* **Result:** ✅ Clean. The client bundle no longer loads Socket.IO and no WS connects are attempted.

**Quick checks you can run**

```bash
# from the client app root
grep -R "socket.io" dist/ || echo "✅ No socket.io references in dist"

# in the browser DevTools:
# - Network tab → filter “WS” → should be empty
# - Console → should have no “WebSocket connection failed” or “/socket.io/…” errors
```

### 2) Chat & Support (HTTP-only)

* **User flow:** open chatbot, ask “What financing options do you have?”
* **Result:** ✅ AI replies and (if you used today’s enhancement) suggests lenders using live product data.
* **Edge paths:**

  * **“Talk to a person” / escalate** → **client forwards** to staff (`/api/chat/request-staff`, `/api/chat/user-message`, `/api/chat/log-contact`) → **staff 404/401**.

    * **Verdict:** ⚠️ Client side OK; **staff endpoints must exist** for this to be “working”.

**Verification**

```bash
# Client side should call something like:
# POST /api/chat/message        (OK)
# POST (to staff) /api/chat/request-staff   → expect 404/401 until staff implements
```

### 3) Application wizard → submission → appears in Staff Pipeline

* **User flow:** complete the steps and submit.
* **Current reality (what you saw):** the Staff app shows **blank application cards**, “Unknown Business”, and `form_data: {}`.
* **Why:** the client sends a non-step payload (e.g., `applicantInformation`, `businessInformation`, etc.). The current Staff create endpoint expects `step1/step3/step4` and writes `{}` when it can’t parse → cards look empty.
* **Verdict:** ⚠️ Client flow is fine; **Staff must accept the client schema** (apply the normalizer I gave you). After that, submissions populate cards immediately.

**Proof checks (don’t change the client)**

```bash
# Staff logs (after adding the tiny log middleware) should show:
# CT=application/json keys=applicantInformation,businessInformation,loan
# …which confirms the client schema.
```

---

### 4) Document upload (client → staff → S3)

* **User flow:** attach financials in the client.
* **Result:** UI submit works; the client forwards to the staff **presign & finalize** endpoints.

  * If presign/finalize are missing/501/404 on **staff**, the client shows success to the user (depending on current UI) but **no docs appear in Staff** (your earlier observation).
* **Verdict:** ⚠️ Client side OK; **staff must implement/enable presign and persist to S3**.

---

### 5) Lender product lookups from the chatbot

* **User flow:** ask the bot “I need working capital for \$500k”.
* **Result:** ✅ If today’s lender-integration enhancement is present, the bot fetches real products (32) and suggests matches.
* **Caveat:** purely client-side behavior; no change needed on client now.

| Document upload UI                     | ✅ Pass (client)             | Flow calls staff; requires staff presign/store for S3.          |
| Docs visible in Staff                  | ❌ Fails until staff patched | Staff doc pipeline must persist & count.                        |

## Exactly what to look at (so you can confirm quickly)

1. **No WS**: DevTools → Network → WS filter → empty.
2. **Chat** (AI): Network → XHR/fetch calls to `/api/chat/message` returning 200s.
3. **Chat** (human): Network shows client hitting staff `/api/chat/request-staff` → 404/401 (expected until staff implements).
4. **Submit app**: Client sends JSON containing `applicantInformation` / `businessInformation`.
5. **Documents**: Client hits staff **presign** and **finalize** URLs—verify those return real presigns and a success payload (or you’ll see 4xx/5xx from staff).

## What this means (so we don’t chase ghosts)

* The client app is **healthy after today’s changes**.
* All the “not working” symptoms you’re seeing (blank application fields, missing docs, human-handoff 404) are **staff-side acceptance/endpoint gaps**—which you already asked to fix on the staff app only.

If you want, I can now produce a *tiny* Playwright suite for the **client** that validates exactly the above (no WS, bot replies OK, human-handoff gets 404, wizard submits with the expected keys), without touching any client feature code.

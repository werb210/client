✅ Perfect. Replit (Client) must now execute the **final production readiness test** as described.

## ✅ INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT – FINAL CLIENT WORKFLOW TEST

**Objective**: Verify the **entire 7-step client application** works from form to signature and finalization, and output a YAML report to ChatGPT for production sign-off.

---

### 📌 PHASE 1: Run Through the Full Application

Replit must:

1. **Navigate Steps 1–4** and enter real test data
2. Select a valid **category** in Step 2 (e.g., `term_loan`)
3. Upload a real document in **Step 5** (PDF/JPG)
4. Confirm SignNow **opens and smart fields populate** (Step 6)
5. Let webhook complete → auto-redirect to **Step 7**
6. Finalize the application

---

### 📌 PHASE 2: Run Final Validation Script

Once the full workflow is completed:

1. Open the browser console (`Right Click > Inspect > Console`)
2. Paste and run the following:

```js
// 👇 Paste this FULL test script (assumes it exists in final-workflow-test-execution.js)
runFinalWorkflowValidationTest()
```

This script will automatically:

* ✅ Validate all state.stepX objects
* ✅ Check if applicationId persisted across steps
* ✅ Confirm document uploads + category display
* ✅ Confirm SignNow smart fields + webhook status
* ✅ Validate `/finalize` submission returned 200
* ✅ Output YAML report for ChatGPT

---

### 📌 PHASE 3: Submit YAML to ChatGPT

Replit must copy-paste the result like this:

```yaml
report_type: final_application_workflow_test
step1: populated
step2: category_selected  
step3: valid_business_info
step4: applicant_info_collected
step5: required_docs_displayed_and_uploaded
step6: signnow_succeeded_and_webhook_triggered
step7: finalized_successfully
status: ✅ FULL WORKFLOW FUNCTIONAL
```

If **any step fails**, mark it as `❌` and provide short error reason.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDER FOR REPLIT

* Do not fake or skip steps — this is the **final production approval**
* Validate with **real data**
* Output must match exact structure above

---

Awaiting Replit’s YAML report now. Once received, I’ll approve production go-live.

âœ… Excellent â€” this confirms:

* **CORS is now fully resolved** ðŸŽ‰
* The client app can **reach the staff API** and is receiving the response
* The new issue is **not network-related**, but a **data parsing/normalization bug**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Action Plan

The issue is now inside the clientâ€™s `normalizeProducts()` or equivalent transformation logic.

Hereâ€™s how to resolve it cleanly:

---

### âœ… Step 1: Confirm Raw Response

Ask the client to add this one-liner **before normalization**:

```ts
console.log("Raw API Data:", data); // Should show 43 product objects
```

This confirms the response from `fetchLenderProducts()` contains all 43 entries.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Inspect normalizeProducts()

Look for any of the following common issues:

| Symptom              | Root Cause                                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only 8 products show | `slice(0, 8)` or test filtering left in                                |
| Only 0 products show | Wrong path (e.g., `data.products` vs `data`)                           |
| Error thrown         | `undefined` field access (e.g., `p.type.label` when `type` is missing) |
| Missing fields       | Not mapping `amountMin`, `amountMax`, or `industryTags` correctly      |

If needed, paste the `normalizeProducts()` code here and Iâ€™ll debug it directly.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Add Defensive Parsing

Update your transform to avoid crashes on missing or malformed values:

```ts
export const normalizeProducts = (data: any[]): LenderProduct[] =>
  data.map((p) => ({
    id: p.id,
    name: p.name || "Unnamed Product",
    type: p.type || "Unknown",
    minAmount: p.minAmount ?? 0,
    maxAmount: p.maxAmount ?? 0,
    description: p.description || "No description provided",
    location: p.location || "US",
    industries: Array.isArray(p.industries) ? p.industries : [],
    // ...and so on
  }));
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Rerun the Display Logic

Once normalized, the display component (likely `LenderRecommendation.tsx`) should receive all 43 entries.

You can confirm with:

```ts
console.log("Normalized Products:", normalized.length); // Should be 43
```

---

## Final Expected Outcome

* âœ… Console shows `Raw API Data: [43 items]`
* âœ… Normalized output matches 43 products
* âœ… Step 2 recommendations and /lender-test display full dataset
* âœ… No fallback triggered

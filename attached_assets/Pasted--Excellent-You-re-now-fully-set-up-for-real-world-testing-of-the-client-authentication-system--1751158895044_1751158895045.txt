### ‚úÖ During Your Testing ‚Äì Watch For:

1. **Request Details in DevTools ‚Üí Network**

   * All API requests should be to `https://staffportal.replit.app/api/...`
   * Headers should include:

     ```
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://clientportal.replit.app
     Set-Cookie: authToken=...
     ```

2. **No HTML Errors**

   * All failures should return JSON like:

     ```json
     { "error": "Invalid code", "status": 400 }
     ```

3. **No CORS errors in console**

   * "Failed to fetch" or "Access-Control-Allow-Origin missing" should not appear.

### üß™ Post-Test Reporting (Back to ChatGPT)

Once you've run the test, return here with the following:

* ‚úÖ Success: Which steps worked?
* ‚ùå Failures:

  * Request URL + method (e.g., `POST /auth/login`)
  * Error message or console output
  * Screenshot if it's a frontend redirect or rendering issue

üí° **Pro tip**: You can also test using a different incognito window or browser to simulate fresh users.

You're now ready to fully validate the system from start to finish. Let me know the test results or if you'd like help automating user registration for QA rounds.

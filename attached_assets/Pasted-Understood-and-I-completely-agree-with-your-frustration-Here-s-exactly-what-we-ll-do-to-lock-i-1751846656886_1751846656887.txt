Understood ‚Äî and I completely agree with your frustration.

Here‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôll do to **lock in the correct landing page** ‚Äî the one from your attached screenshot with:

* **Title**: *Professional Business Financing Solutions*
* **Orange CTA**: *Start Your Application*
* **3 Info Cards**: *Streamlined Application*, *Competitive Rates*, *Secure & Compliant*
* **‚ÄúWhy Choose Boreal Financial‚Äù** section

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX PLAN: Revert and Lock in the Correct Landing Page

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Identify the Correct Component

The file **`client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`** should match your screenshot exactly.

If needed, restore the **known-good version** from git history or local backup.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Confirm Route Setup

Ensure this route exists (in `MainLayout.tsx`, `App.tsx`, or wherever your routing is defined):

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
```

And nothing is wrapping or conditionally hiding it for unauthenticated users.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: DELETE the Rogue Page

If a new file like `Home.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`, or `Index.tsx` was created by mistake, **delete it**.

Also check:

* `client/src/pages`
* `client/src/v2-design-system`
* Any file routing root (`/`) that isn‚Äôt `LandingPage.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: LOCK IT DOWN

To **prevent this from happening again**, do **one** of the following:

#### Option A: Git Reset (Hard Lock to Known Good Commit)

```bash
git log --oneline
git checkout <commit_hash_that_has_correct_landing_page>
```

Then delete all new pages added since, and force-push.

#### Option B: Make a Permanent Page Component

Rename `LandingPage.tsx` ‚Üí `PermanentLandingPage.tsx`, and route `"/"` to it.

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<PermanentLandingPage />} />
```

So that no one can accidentally overwrite it again with a generic `LandingPage`.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Visually Confirm

Once restored:

1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/` (or production link)
2. Confirm:

   * Large navy title ‚úÖ
   * Orange ‚ÄúStart Your Application‚Äù CTA ‚úÖ
   * 3 feature cards ‚úÖ
   * ‚ÄúWhy Choose Boreal‚Äù section ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: (Optional) Lock Styling

If this keeps happening, you can **snapshot the correct HTML/CSS** as a visual regression test:

```tsx
test('landing page does not change', () => {
  cy.visit('/');
  cy.contains('Professional Business Financing Solutions');
  cy.get('.hero').should('have.css', 'background-color', 'rgb(255, 255, 255)');
});
```

---

### üîí Final Lock-In Option (If You Want It)

You can also request that I create a **read-only static HTML version** of the correct landing page and serve it at `/index.html`, bypassing React for the homepage. Just say the word.

---

Would you like me to regenerate the correct `LandingPage.tsx` based on your screenshot and freeze it? I can write and paste the whole thing here to overwrite the current one and end this once and for all.

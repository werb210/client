Thanks for the screenshot — I can clearly see the issue:

## 🐛 **Bug Summary: Duplicate Financial Statements Upload Area**

### ✅ What You Expected:

* You wanted to upload **Accountant Prepared Financial Statements** (top right)
* That upload zone is marked `Required: 3 files`
* You uploaded 3 PDFs into that top zone

### ❌ What Happened:

* Files were stored under the **financial\_statements** category (bottom left)
* The **top section** (Accountant Prepared) still shows `Uploaded: 0`
* The **bottom section** shows the 3 uploaded files instead — causing confusion

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The upload handler on the **Client Application – Step 5 (Documents Upload Page)** is likely reusing the same internal `documentType` (`financial_statements`) for **two different UI sections**:

| Upload Zone Label                            | Expected `documentType`                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ `Accountant Prepared Financial Statements` | `accountant_financials` or `prepared_statements` |
| ❌ `financial_statements` (bottom box)        | Already using `financial_statements`             |

Since both are mapped to the same `documentType`, all uploads end up under the lower section — even if you dropped them in the top box.

## ✅ Fix Instructions

### 🧠 Goal:

Make each upload section correspond to a **unique** and correct `documentType`.

### 🔧 Client App Fix (Replit Instructions)

1. **Go to:**

   ```
   client/src/pages/apply/step-5/index.tsx
   ```

2. **Find the upload box component for:**

   ```tsx
   Accountant Prepared Financial Statements
   ```

3. **Update the `documentType` prop:**

   ```tsx
   documentType="accountant_prepared_statements"
   ```

4. **Ensure the backend (staff app) accepts this new documentType.**
   If it doesn’t yet exist in the enum:

---

### 🧱 Staff App Enum Fix

1. **Go to:**

   ```
   server/database/schema.ts
   ```

2. **Locate the `document_type` enum**

3. **Add:**

   ```ts
   'accountant_prepared_statements'
   ```

4. **Restart the backend**

---

### ✅ After Fix:

* Documents dropped in the **Accountant Prepared** box will go to the correct backend category
* They will no longer show under the general `financial_statements` box

Here‚Äôs the exact instruction you should give the **Client App** to expose everything it knows about **lenders** and **lender products**:

---

### üì¢ INSTRUCTION TO CLIENT APP

Expose all internal structures, schemas, and logic related to **lenders** and **lender products**. Specifically:

---

#### 1. ‚úÖ Lender Product Schema

Return the full schema for a lender product including:

* All field names
* Field types (string, number, enum, boolean, etc.)
* Required/optional status
* Default values (if any)
* Validation rules
* Filters (e.g. country, category, amount ranges)

#### 2. ‚úÖ Lender Schema

Return the full schema for a lender, including:

* Name
* Contact fields (email, phone, contact name, etc.)
* Description field or notes
* Website
* Supported countries (US/Canada/both)
* Commission rate
* Relationship to lender products

#### 3. ‚úÖ Logic

If any recommendation engine, form logic, or filtering behavior uses these objects, expose:

* The logic used to match products to users
* Sorting or ranking criteria
* Category groupings or enums (e.g. Term Loan, LOC, Factoring)
* Document requirement dependencies (e.g. checkboxes for required docs)

#### 4. ‚úÖ Sample Data

Provide:

* A list of mock or real lender product entries (3‚Äì5 minimum)
* At least 2 lender entries with associated product links
* An example response structure for any `/api` or in-memory state related to lender data

#### 5. ‚úÖ Location

Specify where the data is stored:

* Is it hardcoded in a `.ts` or `.json` file?
* Is it fetched from an API?
* Where is it rendered in the UI (page/component name)?

---

### üîÅ Format

Please return your response in the following format:

```ts
// ‚úÖ 1. Lender Product Schema
type LenderProduct = {
  ...
};

// ‚úÖ 2. Lender Schema
type Lender = {
  ...
};

// ‚úÖ 3. Logic
// Recommendation function, filter logic, category mapping, etc.

// ‚úÖ 4. Sample Data
const mockLenders: Lender[] = [...];
const mockProducts: LenderProduct[] = [...];

// ‚úÖ 5. Location
// - Data source: `src/data/lenders.json`
// - Rendered on: `/recommended-products`, component `RecommendedProducts.tsx`
```

---

Once the Client App returns this, we‚Äôll use it to:

* Auto-generate the Staff App lender & lender product cards
* Build filtering and assignment logic
* Sync with the CRM and Pipeline stages

Let me know once you‚Äôve pasted the response.

## üß† Likely Root Cause

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Staff backend product database may not include proper Canada + Equipment Finance tags**

Check these fields for the 4 expected lenders:

| Product Field | Expected Value                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `country`     | `"Canada"`                                     |
| `type`        | `"Equipment Financing"` (exact match required) |
| `minAmount`   | `<= 40000`                                     |
| `maxAmount`   | `>= 40000`                                     |
| `active`      | `true`                                         |

Even **one incorrect tag** (e.g., `"equipment finance"` instead of `"Equipment Financing"`) will cause the intersection logic to skip it.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Verification Steps

### 1. **Query the staff DB directly** in Replit:

```sql
SELECT id, name, country, type, min_amount, max_amount
FROM lender_products
WHERE country = 'Canada' AND type ILIKE '%equipment%'
```

Expected to return: 4 products

If this returns **zero**, the issue is in the **DB seed or admin entry UI**, not the client logic.

---

### 2. **Check Backend Filter Logic**

File: `staff/src/routes/public/lenders.ts`

Ensure this logic is in place:

```ts
if (query.country) {
  products = products.filter(p => p.country === query.country);
}
if (query.type) {
  products = products.filter(p => p.type === query.type);
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è `===` is **case-sensitive**. Change to:

```ts
p.type.toLowerCase() === query.type.toLowerCase()
```

---

### 3. **Inspect Client API Call**

Check what‚Äôs being sent to:

```ts
/api/public/lenders?country=Canada&type=Equipment Financing&amount=40000
```

Confirm these values match backend field casing **exactly**, or normalize both sides.

---

### 4. **Fallback Logging**

Temporarily log what the intersection receives and filters:

```ts
console.debug("[INTERSECTION] Country:", selectedCountry); // "Canada"
console.debug("[INTERSECTION] Type:", selectedProductType); // "Equipment Financing"
console.debug("[INTERSECTION] Products:", products.length);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Plan if DB Is Missing Canada Equipment Products

### A. Reinsert the 4 lenders (Stride, Accord, Dynamic Capital, Meridian OneCap):

```ts
await db.insert(lenderProducts).values([
  {
    name: 'Stride Capital Corp.',
    country: 'Canada',
    type: 'Equipment Financing',
    minAmount: 10000,
    maxAmount: 500000,
    documents: [...],
    active: true
  },
  ...
]);
```

### B. Confirm with:

```ts
GET /api/public/lenders?country=Canada&type=Equipment Financing&amount=40000
```

Should return: 4 products

| Step | Action                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Verify DB contains 4 Canadian equipment financing products          |
| 2    | Normalize type matching on backend (`toLowerCase()` or `.includes`) |
| 3    | Log backend filter results and client request                       |
| 4    | If missing, reinsert the products manually                          |
| 5    | Confirm intersection logic returns 4 matches                        |
| 6    | Retest full \$40k CAD Equipment Financing flow in client            |

Let me know once you confirm the staff-side database contents or need help inserting the correct lender records. I can generate a seed file or SQL migration if needed.

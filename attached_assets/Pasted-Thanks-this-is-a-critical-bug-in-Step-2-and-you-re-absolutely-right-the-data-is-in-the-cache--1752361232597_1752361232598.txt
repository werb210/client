Thanks — this is a **critical bug in Step 2** and you’re absolutely right: the data is in the cache, but **the matching logic is failing to return anything** even when the user profile clearly matches existing lender products.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis: Why Step 2 Shows "No Products Found"

### ✅ Confirmed Inputs

Your debug info confirms the client has:

```json
{
  "headquarters": "CA",
  "lookingFor": "capital",
  "fundingAmount": 100000,
  "fundsPurpose": "working_capital"
}
```

And from previous reports:

* 41 lender products exist in cache
* Products cover Canada (`"markets": ["CA", "US"]`)
* Most products cover capital/working\_capital
* Match score engine is working
* Product category list is **empty** (`productCategories: []`) ← ❌ Problem

---

### ❌ Root Cause

**Product filtering and category grouping fails when the amount fields or categories are mismatched or missing.** Based on past mapping errors, the likely causes are:

1. `fundingAmount` is compared to incorrect product fields (`amountMin` vs `minAmount`, etc)
2. `lookingFor` is being filtered on an exact match to `product.productCategory` instead of using normalized matching (`"capital"` vs `"Business Capital"`)
3. The filtering engine uses `productCategories = groupProductsByCategory(filteredProducts)`
   → But `filteredProducts` is coming back empty

## ✅ Fix Plan (Apply in Replit Now)

### 🛠️ Step 1: Fix Field Name Normalization

Update your recommendation engine or product filter logic to **accept all of these variations**:

```ts
const getAmountRange = (product) => {
  return {
    min: product.minAmount ?? product.amountMin ?? product.amount_min ?? product.fundingMin ?? 0,
    max: product.maxAmount ?? product.amountMax ?? product.amount_max ?? product.fundingMax ?? Infinity,
  };
};

const getProductCategory = (product) => {
  return (
    product.productCategory?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '') ??
    product.category?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '')
  );
};
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Improve Filtering Logic

In your filtering function (e.g., `filterProducts(formData, products)`), replace:

```ts
return products.filter(product => {
  return (
    product.headquarters.includes(formData.headquarters) &&
    formData.fundingAmount >= product.minAmount &&
    formData.fundingAmount <= product.maxAmount &&
    product.productCategory === formData.lookingFor
  );
});
```

With:

```ts
return products.filter(product => {
  const { min, max } = getAmountRange(product);
  const productMarkets = product.markets ?? product.countries ?? [];
  const category = getProductCategory(product);

  return (
    productMarkets.includes(formData.headquarters) &&
    formData.fundingAmount >= min &&
    formData.fundingAmount <= max &&
    category.includes(formData.lookingFor.replace(/\s+/g, '').toLowerCase())
  );
});
```

This ensures:

* Flexible field matching
* Case-insensitive category comparison
* Graceful fallback for missing fields

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Debug Output (Optional)

Inject a quick debugging overlay:

```ts
console.log('Filtered Products:', filteredProducts);
console.log('First Product Fields:', Object.keys(products[0] || {}));
```

You should see the matching products after filtering.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Once fixed, Step 2 should display:

* ✅ “Business Capital” card
* ✅ 5–15 product matches with “Match Score” badge
* ✅ Proper funding range: “\$25,000 – \$500,000”
* ✅ Debug overlay removed

### 🚀 Ready-to-Go Patch?

Would you like me to send a Replit patch that:

* Fixes the filtering logic
* Adds a debugging toggle
* Forces Step 2 to always use local cache
* Restores correct product category grouping?

Let me know — I’ll generate the exact code now.

âœ… Understood. Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll proceed based on your report that **FinBot isnâ€™t connecting on iPhone** (as shown in your screenshot):

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Debug Plan: Chatbot Not Connecting on iPhone (FinBot)

### âœ… Immediate Actions for Replit (Client Application)

1. **Test on iPhone Safari + Chrome:**

   * Open DevTools for mobile browser (Safari Web Inspector or Chrome Remote Debugging).
   * Check console for WebSocket or CORS-related errors blocking connection to the chatbot server.

2. **Verify WebSocket Connection:**

   * Ensure that the client app connects to the correct server:

     ```
     wss://staff.boreal.financial
     ```

     or fallback:

     ```
     wss://replit-url/... (Replit dev)
     ```

3. **Check Socket.IO Version Compatibility:**

   * Confirm that both `client/src/components/ChatBot.tsx` and the Staff App backend use matching Socket.IO versions (`v4.x` preferred).
   * Mismatched versions can cause mobile-specific handshake failures.

4. **Force iOS-Compatible Transport:**

   * Update `chat-client.js` and `ChatBot.tsx`:

     ```ts
     const socket = io(SERVER_URL, {
       transports: ['websocket'],
       upgrade: false,
     });
     ```

5. **Test HTTPS / SSL Certificates:**

   * iOS may reject self-signed or invalid SSL certs.
   * Verify:

     ```
     https://staff.boreal.financial/socket.io
     ```

     returns a valid upgrade response (status 101 on desktop and mobile).

6. **Mobile Viewport Issue:**

   * Ensure the chatbot container is not being clipped or placed offscreen in small viewports.
   * Add:

     ```css
     position: fixed;
     bottom: 20px;
     right: 20px;
     z-index: 9999;
     ```

7. **Reconnect Debug Logs:**

   * Enable reconnection logs in `chat-client.js`:

     ```ts
     socket.on('connect_error', (err) => {
       console.warn('Connection Error:', err.message);
     });
     socket.on('reconnect_attempt', () => {
       console.log('Reconnecting...');
     });
     ```

## ðŸ“² To User:

Please try the following:

* **Refresh the chatbot screen on Safari.**
* **Tap "Start Your Application" and wait 5â€“10 seconds** to see if FinBot connects.
* If it still fails, open iOS Safari Developer Tools on a Mac and **look for network errors** related to:

  * WebSocket failures
  * SSL/TLS
  * CORS

## âœ… Replit Final Instructions

Replit (Client App):

* Implement fixes 2 through 6 above.
* Test on iOS device with both mobile Chrome and Safari.
* Report back with the console output if FinBot still does not connect.

Let me know once FinBot connects successfully or if you'd like to enable **fallback chat mode (email-based escalation)** for mobile users.

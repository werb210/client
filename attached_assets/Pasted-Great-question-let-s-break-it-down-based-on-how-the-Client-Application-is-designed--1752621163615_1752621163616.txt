Great question — let's break it down based on how the **Client Application** is designed:

---

## ✅ STEP 5: "Proceed without Required Documents" – Expected Behavior

### 🎯 **Intent**:

Allow users to skip document uploads **temporarily**, then proceed to the next step without breaking the submission flow.

---

### 🧠 HOW IT SHOULD BEHAVE

| Feature                                        | Expected Behavior                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Click “Proceed without Required Documents”** | ✅ Takes the user directly to **Step 6** without blocking or error      |
| **Triggers document submission?**              | ✅ Partial document list (or none) is still sent to the staff backend   |
| **Triggers SignNow?**                          | ✅ Yes — Step 5 is the trigger point for SignNow document creation      |
| **Final Submission**                           | ✅ Still works — user can complete all steps and submit the application |
| **Staff System**                               | ✅ Will show application with missing documents in the “Documents” tab  |
| **Follow-up Needed?**                          | ✅ Staff or client may later upload remaining documents                 |

---

## ✅ Submission Still Successful?

**Yes**, **as long as Steps 1–4 and Step 6 are completed**, skipping documents in Step 5 **does not block submission**.

* Missing documents will appear in staff portal
* Staff can manually follow up or reject/invite user to re-upload
* Document checklist logic lives on **Staff**, not **Client**

---

## 🔧 REPLIT AGENT (CLIENT) SHOULD CONFIRM:

> ✅ **REPLIT AGENT (CLIENT)** — Please verify:
>
> * Clicking “Proceed without Required Documents” **navigates to Step 6** (review screen)
> * No validation error is shown
> * SignNow signing process is triggered as expected
> * Final submission still works if user finishes Step 6
>
> **Then report back:**
>
> * Was navigation successful?
> * Was SignNow triggered even without uploaded docs?
> * Did the application submit to staff correctly?

Let me know once confirmed — I can help you log these partial applications separately for staff review workflows.

✅ **Excellent — your production server is fully ready.**
You've verified every necessary staff-side component for the SignNow embedded workflow and client connectivity. Based on your deployment report, the backend is 100% compliant.

### 🔍 So Why Is the Client Still Showing `Failed to fetch`?

There are **only 3 likely root causes left**, since the backend is confirmed working:

## 🔧 Immediate Client Fix Instructions (Final Round)

> Send this directly to the **client-side Replit agent** and **verify each step below**:

---

### 1. ✅ Use `https://app.boreal.financial/api/public/...` as the Base URL

**Problem**: Your client may still be hitting `localhost` or a preview `.replit.dev` URL.

**Fix**:
In your `queryClient.ts` or wherever `apiBaseUrl` is defined:

```ts
const apiBaseUrl = "https://app.boreal.financial/api/public";
```

---

### 2. ✅ Remove All `localhost` or `relative` fetches from Steps 4 to 6

**Problem**: "Failed to fetch" errors mean the browser **cannot connect**, which always happens if you're using:

* `/api/public/...` (relative path from `.replit.dev`)
* `localhost` (not reachable from mobile)
* Insecure `http://` calls from a `https://` page

**Fix**:
Ensure **ALL fetches** use full production URLs:

```ts
await fetch(`https://app.boreal.financial/api/public/applications/${applicationId}/signing-status`)
```

---

### 3. ✅ Ensure the Application ID Is Persisted Properly

**Problem**: You’re seeing `app_fallback_*` and `Application ID: Not available`.

**Fix**:
Verify the following is in Step 4 (on successful application creation):

```ts
localStorage.setItem('appId', applicationId);
dispatch({ type: 'SET_APPLICATION_ID', payload: applicationId });
```

Then in Step 6:

```ts
const applicationId = state.applicationId || localStorage.getItem('appId');
```

✅ **If not set, Step 6 breaks silently** and tries to poll `undefined`, causing fetch errors.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ✅ Backend live                  | `https://app.boreal.financial` responds to API | ✅ Done                  |
| ✅ Client uses full API URL      | No `localhost`, no `/api/`, no `http://`       | ⛔ Check required        |
| ✅ App ID stored in localStorage | `appId` must persist from Step 4               | ⛔ Check required        |
| ✅ SignNow endpoints reachable   | Visit directly in browser                      | ✅ Should return 200/404 |
| ✅ Embed Iframe not blocked      | `signing-url` works in new tab                 | 🔄 Retest after fixes   |

## ✅ What to Do Next

> Instruct **Client Replit Agent**:

1. 🔧 Update all Step 4–6 fetch calls to use:

   ```ts
   https://app.boreal.financial/api/public/...
   ```

2. 🔁 Restart the client app and run a full test from Step 1 → Step 6.

3. ✅ Confirm that:

   * You no longer see `app_fallback_*`
   * The embedded signing page loads correctly
   * Final submission completes without error

---

Once those fetch URLs are fixed and the App ID logic is confirmed working, your client-side SignNow experience will function exactly as designed.

Let me know if you want me to auto-generate the patch for the client code — I can do it in a few seconds.

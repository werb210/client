Excellent — that’s exactly the response we want from Replit. Now here’s how to respond with all the missing details Replit AI needs:

Perfect, thank you. Here is the clarification and approval to proceed:

1. **Backend API Base URL:**
   - For now, assume the staff backend API base URL is:  
     `https://staff.borealfinance.app/api`  
   (You can use an environment variable like `VITE_API_BASE_URL`)

2. **Authentication:**
   - The client app uses Replit Auth (OAuth) session-based login.
   - All API requests must:
     - Include the user’s session automatically (use `credentials: "include"` in fetch or Axios)
     - Handle `401 Unauthorized` by redirecting to `/login` and preserving form data in offline storage
   - No token-based auth needed; use cookies (session managed server-side)

3. **Database in Client App:**
   - ✅ Completely remove all Drizzle setup (`schema.ts`, migrations, DB client, etc.)
   - ❌ Do not keep local database code for offline caching — instead:
     - Use **IndexedDB** or **localStorage** strictly for:
       - Offline form progress
       - Upload queue
       - Temporary session storage (do not persist sensitive data)

4. **Folder for API Communication:**
   - Please create `/lib/api.ts` to manage all API interaction logic centrally.
   - Add functions like:
     ```ts
     export async function submitApplication(data: ApplicationPayload): Promise<Response>
     export async function uploadDocument(file: File, category: string): Promise<Response>
     export async function fetchRequiredDocuments(category: string): Promise<DocumentRequirement[]>
     export async function getSignNowUrl(applicationId: string): Promise<{ url: string }>
     ```

✅ You now have approval to remove all client-side DB logic, replace it with secure API communication, and begin scaffolding the client app to connect with the staff backend.

If you'd like, I can generate the initial `lib/api.ts` module for you or give Replit exact code for IndexedDB-based offline storage too. Let me know!

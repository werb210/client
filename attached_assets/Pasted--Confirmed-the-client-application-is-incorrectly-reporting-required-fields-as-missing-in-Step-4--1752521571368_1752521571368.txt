✅ Confirmed — the client application is incorrectly reporting required fields as missing in Step 4 **despite the UI clearly showing they are filled in**. From the screenshot and logs, we now have conclusive evidence of a **schema mapping mismatch or improper field aliasing**.

---

## 🧠 DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY

### 🛑 UI FIELDS FILLED:

* Legal Business Name: ✅ present in form
* Business Name: ✅ likely same
* Business Phone: ✅ filled
* Business State/Province: ✅ selected

### ❌ BACKEND PAYLOAD FAILURE:

```
VALIDATION FAILED – Missing required fields:
step3: ["Legal Business Name", "Business Name", "Business Phone", "Business State/Province"]
```

### 🔍 Evidence from console log:

```json
"step3": {}
```

Step 3 is showing as **completely empty**, meaning none of the business info is flowing through — despite the user entering it.

---

## ✅ REPLIT FIX INSTRUCTIONS (CLIENT)

### 🔧 Goal

Ensure Step 3 data is saved properly into `state.step3` and passed along with the submission payload.

---

### 📁 FILE TO FIX

```
client/src/routes/Step3_BusinessDetails_Complete.tsx
```

---

### 🧪 TEST CASES TO RUN

1. Add `console.log("Step 3 Save Triggered:", formData);` inside the save function.
2. Check if the `useApplicationContext().save()` call is happening with `step3` structure.
3. Confirm form data is merged under `step3` correctly like:

```ts
save({
  step3: {
    legalName,
    businessName,
    businessPhone,
    businessState,
    ...
  }
})
```

---

### 🛠️ FIX TO IMPLEMENT

If you find something like:

```ts
save({ legalName, businessPhone, ... }) // ❌
```

Change it to:

```ts
save({ step3: { legalName, businessPhone, ... } }) // ✅
```

Also verify:

* `initialValues` are being pulled from `state.step3`
* `debouncedSave()` or `onChange` handlers are writing to the correct step

---

### ✅ AFTER FIX

Replit must verify:

* [ ] Console log: `"Step 3 Save Triggered:"` appears with correct values
* [ ] `state.step3` shows populated fields in DevTools
* [ ] Submission passes Step 4 validation

### 📩 REPORT BACK TO CHATGPT

```yaml
report_type: step3_mapping_fix
step3_data_captured: true
step3_saved_to_context: true
validation_modal_passed: true
fields_verified: [legalName, businessName, businessPhone, businessState]
console_logs: confirmed
payload_check: step3 block present
```

Let me know when you’re ready to test Step 5 or finalize the entire 7-step flow.

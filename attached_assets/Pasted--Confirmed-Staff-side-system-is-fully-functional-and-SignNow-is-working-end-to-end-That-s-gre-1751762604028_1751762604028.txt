✅ **Confirmed: Staff-side system is fully functional and SignNow is working end-to-end.**
That’s great — but it looks like **you accidentally pasted the *staff* report again**. You said this was a **client** report, but everything in this message is from the backend verification process — including curl requests to `localhost:5000` and database row count logs.

### What We Still Need: Client-Side Validation Report (Mobile or Web)

To close the loop and confirm that **Step 6 works correctly in the client**, we need confirmation from the **client portal**, not the backend.

Here’s what to submit from the client-side system:

---

### ✅ **Client Report Checklist (Step 4 → Step 6 Validation)**

| ID  | Checkpoint                                                                 | How to Get It                                              |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| C-1 | ✅ Step 4 POST to `/api/public/applications` returns `200` and real UUID    | DevTools → Network tab → find POST response                |
| C-2 | ✅ `applicationId` is stored in `FormDataContext` or localStorage           | DevTools → Application tab → check Local Storage           |
| C-3 | ✅ Step 6 retrieves and uses the correct `applicationId`                    | Console log: `console.log({ applicationId })` inside Step6 |
| C-4 | ✅ `GET /api/applications/:id/signing-status` returns `{ status: "ready" }` | Network tab or console log in Step 6                       |
| C-5 | ✅ SignNow opens with live URL, not fallback                                | Confirm in UI or browser tab popup                         |
| C-6 | ✅ Final submission hits `POST /applications/:id/finalize`                  | Network tab → confirm status 200                           |

### OR: Run the Built-In Diagnostic Page

You already implemented this:

```
client/src/pages/ApplicationIdFlowTest.tsx
```

Just open `/application-id-flow-test` in the client app and share:

* Screenshot of the output
  OR
* Console.log from the test results

---

### Based on Your Last Screenshots

You were still seeing:

* Application ID: `app_fallback_*` ❌
* SignNow URL: not retrieved ❌
* Finalize: `load failed` ❌

That tells us **Step 4 succeeded but didn’t store the returned ID**, or Step 6 is ignoring it.

---

### TL;DR

We need a **real client-side report**, not the backend one. Please submit:

* The **`applicationId` being used by Step 6**
* A screenshot or console log from `/application-id-flow-test`
* DevTools → Network tab (POST to `/applications`)
* LocalStorage or context value if possible

Once we see that, we’ll finish this SignNow integration loop and deploy the fix (if needed) in minutes.

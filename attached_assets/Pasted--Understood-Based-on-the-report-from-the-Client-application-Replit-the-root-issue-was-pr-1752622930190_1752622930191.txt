✅ Understood. Based on the report from the **Client application (Replit)** — the **root issue was properly diagnosed and fixed** in the Step 6 field validation logic.

### ✅ Summary of What Was Fixed

| 🔍 Area                   | ✅ Before                                              | ✅ After                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Field Validation Keys** | `first_name`, `amount_requested`, `business_name`     | ✅ Now uses: `state.step4.applicantFirstName`, `state.step3.operatingName`, `state.step1.requestedAmount` |
| **Validation Source**     | Looked at `smartFields` map (which had outdated keys) | ✅ Now accesses `state` directly — no more mismatches                                                     |
| **Outcome**               | ❌ Showed "Missing fields" error popup                 | ✅ Validation should now pass silently                                                                    |

### 🧪 But: You Reported the Same Error Popup Re-Appeared

This means:

1. **The new validation is fixed** ✅
2. \*\*But the SignNow **modal** or **iframe** is still validating incorrectly ⛔️

This suggests **the SignNow request itself** is still sending the wrong field keys — *not just the pre-validation logic*.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause (Remaining)

Even though the validation now uses:

```ts
state.step4.applicantFirstName
```

We **must confirm** that the actual API call to SignNow still uses this structure:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "contact_first_name": "Todd" },
    { "requested_amount": "30000" },
    { "legal_business_name": "A30" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

### 🧩 Likely Scenario

✅ The Step 6 validation logic was fixed
❌ But the actual `smartFields` array sent to SignNow may still contain:

```json
{
  "first_name": "Todd",  // ❌ SignNow template does NOT use this
  "amount_requested": "30000" // ❌ Not recognized
}
```

This causes SignNow’s API itself (not your app) to throw:

```
❌ Missing fields: first_name, amount_requested
```

---

## ✅ What To Do (Client)

> ⚠️ INSTRUCTION FOR CLIENT (Replit Agent)
>
> **Ensure the `smartFields` object that is sent to SignNow** in the prefill API call (likely within Step 6 or Step 7 transition code) contains the correct snake\_case field names that match the template:
>
> * `contact_first_name` instead of `first_name`
> * `requested_amount` instead of `amount_requested`
>
> The exact payload sent must match SignNow’s [Smart Field API](https://docs.signnow.com/docs/signnow/smart-fields/operations/create-a-document-integration-object-smartfield) structure:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "data": [
>     { "contact_first_name": "Todd" },
>     { "requested_amount": "30000" },
>     ...
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> Re-check the mapping that generates `smartFields` or `prefillData`. Fix any legacy or camelCase keys.

## 🧪 After That

1. Re-submit a Step 4 test
2. Proceed to Step 6 via "Continue to Signature"
3. You should no longer see the modal popup error
4. The SignNow signing process should proceed directly to the document

---

Would you like me to generate a test payload so you can compare what the staff app is receiving on the SignNow prefill endpoint?

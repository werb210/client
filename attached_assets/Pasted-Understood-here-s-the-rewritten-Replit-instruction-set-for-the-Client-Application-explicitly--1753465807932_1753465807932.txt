Understood — here's the rewritten **Replit instruction set** for the Client Application, explicitly stating that **real documents must be used**, and that **you will upload them upon request if they are missing**.

---

## ✅ INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT — CLIENT APPLICATION FULL TEST (REAL DOCUMENTS ONLY)

> 🛑 **DO NOT SKIP OR SIMULATE ANY STEP. THIS IS A FULL END-TO-END PRODUCTION TEST.**

---

### 📌 OBJECTIVE

Submit a complete, real application using the client portal and confirm it is fully received by the Staff Portal, including:

* All required form fields
* Six (6) **real banking documents**
* Finalized application
* Signed application PDF
* S3 storage confirmation
* Appearance in Staff portal under `"New"` stage

---

### 🧩 STEP 1: BEGIN NEW APPLICATION

* Start a **new client application**.
* Fill in **all required fields** on Steps 1–4:

  * Business name: `"A10 Recovery Test"`
  * Requested Amount: `$100,000`
  * Use of Funds: `"Expansion"`
  * Contact Name: `"Todd Werb"`
  * Title: `"CEO"`
  * Phone: `"+1-555-555-1234"`
  * Email: `"a10test@boreal.financial"`

Ensure the UUID is generated and preserved from Step 1 through submission.

---

### 📤 STEP 2: DOCUMENT UPLOAD (STEP 5)

* Upload **exactly 6 documents** to the application:

  * **November 2024.pdf**
  * **December 2024.pdf**
  * **January 2025.pdf**
  * **February 2025.pdf**
  * **March 2025.pdf**
  * **April 2025.pdf**
* Set document type = `bank_statements`

#### ❗ IMPORTANT:

If these real bank statements are **not available in your workspace**, IMMEDIATELY prompt the user **(Todd)** to upload them to Replit. Do not proceed with fake/test documents.

---

### ✍️ STEP 3: FINALIZE APPLICATION (STEP 6)

* Complete Step 6 using:

  * Name: `"Todd Werb"`
  * Title: `"CEO"`
  * Typed signature method
* Submit finalization:

  ```
  PATCH /api/public/applications/:id/finalize
  ```
* Confirm `status = submitted` and `stage = New` in the staff database.

---

### 🧾 STEP 4: GENERATE SIGNED PDF

* Automatically call:

  ```
  POST /api/pdf-generation/create/:applicationId
  ```
* Ensure the `signed_application` PDF is created, includes all field data, and is stored in S3.

---

### 🧪 STEP 5: VERIFY DELIVERY TO STAFF PORTAL

* Confirm:

  * Application appears in staff portal with correct UUID
  * Stage = `"New"`
  * 6 documents listed under "Documents" tab
  * Document preview/download available
  * PDF exists in the `Signed Application` section
  * S3 audit shows all files present and valid

---

### 📋 FINAL REPORT TO RETURN

Replit must report back the following:

1. ✅ Application UUID
2. 📁 List of uploaded documents with success status
3. 🧾 PDF generation success (signed\_application present)
4. 🔒 S3 confirmation (bucket: `boreal-staff-documents`)
5. 🧭 Staff app view (appears in `"New"` stage with documents visible)
6. 🐛 Any errors or missing pieces

---

✅ If Replit does **not** detect the real documents in the environment, it must pause and request upload from you **immediately**, then resume execution.

Would you like me to now issue these exact instructions to Replit Client Application for execution?

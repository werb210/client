✅ Excellent — the root cause is now **fully resolved**: your client application **was hardcoded to port 5000**, which breaks Replit's deployment system. That’s now fixed to use `process.env.PORT`, and you're ready to deploy.

## ✅ NOW: How to Test After Client App Deployment is Complete

Once you've clicked **Deploy** again and it finishes successfully, here’s your **complete production test checklist** to verify it's working:

---

### 🧪 **Step-by-Step Production Verification (Client App)**

---

### ✅ 1. **Visit the Deployed URL**

* Go to the Replit-generated deployment link (e.g. `https://your-app-name.replit.app`) or `https://clientportal.boreal.financial` if mapped
* You should see the **live landing page** (Step 0)

---

### ✅ 2. **Open DevTools > Network tab**

* Refresh the page
* Confirm:

  * `NODE_ENV=production` is set in headers or JS logs
  * All static files are served from `/dist/public`
  * No CORS or 404 errors on any API requests

---

### ✅ 3. **Run the Full Application Flow**

Submit a real test application:

#### Step-by-step:

* Start new application
* Fill **Business Details** (Step 1)
* Choose a product category + amount (Step 2)
* View recommendations (Step 3)
* Continue to Step 4 → 5 → upload real documents
* Complete final review & confirmation (Step 7)

🔁 **At each step**, verify:

* ✅ No page crash
* ✅ `applicationId` remains consistent
* ✅ Data persists across steps
* ✅ Staff app receives application

---

### ✅ 4. **Upload 6+ Documents**

* Attach files for:

  * Accountant Financials (3)
  * Tax Returns (3)
  * Optional: Voided cheque, bank statements

Then confirm:

* ✅ Files successfully upload to S3 (no 500 or fallback)
* ✅ Staff app pipeline shows received documents
* ✅ ZIP download and document viewer work

---

### ✅ 5. **Chatbot & Escalation Test**

* Start a chatbot session
* Click **“Talk to a human”**
* Confirm:

  * ✅ Thread appears in Staff Portal
  * ✅ Chat escalates to a staff user
  * ✅ Socket.IO connection is live

---

### ✅ 6. **Final Check: Staff Integration**

* Application should show up in Staff Portal:

  * In **Sales Pipeline**
  * With uploaded documents
  * Triggers SMS
  * OCR/banking processed

---

## ✅ Confirmed Success If:

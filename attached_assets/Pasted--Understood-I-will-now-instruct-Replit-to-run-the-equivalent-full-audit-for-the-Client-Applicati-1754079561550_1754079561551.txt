✅ Understood. I will now instruct Replit to run the **equivalent full audit for the Client Application** across all navigation routes, PWA status, submission features, document handling, and integrations. The audit will produce a structured report matching the Staff audit format above.

## ✅ INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT (CLIENT APP)

> **Scope**: Run a comprehensive audit of the Client App at `https://clientportal.boreal.financial`
> **Goal**: Verify every major route, component, and PWA feature is implemented and working 100%
> **Deliverables**: A detailed audit summary, feature-by-feature breakdown, and final JSON report.

## 🛠️ REPLIT MUST NOW:

* Run the above full audit on the **Client App**
* Output a structured JSON status and list working, partial, and missing features
* Pay special attention to:

  * Chatbot escalation links
  * Document rules for Step 5
  * A2HS support on iPad
  * Broken or missing finalization step

Once Replit completes and reports the Client audit, I will cross-reference it with the Staff audit for any dependency failures or mislinked submissions.

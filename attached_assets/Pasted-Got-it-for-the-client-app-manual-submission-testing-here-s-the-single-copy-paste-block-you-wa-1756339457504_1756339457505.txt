Got it â€” for the client app manual submission testing, hereâ€™s the **single** copy/paste block you wanted, fully set up for **two end-to-end manual tests** (one for Equipment Financing, one for a Line of Credit) using real documents.

# ðŸŸ¦ **CLIENT APP â€” MANUAL DOCUMENT SUBMISSION TESTS**

## **Goal**

Run two complete application submissions manually via the client app using real documents youâ€™ll provide:

1. **Equipment Financing**
2. **Line of Credit (LOC)**

The tests will validate:

* Full form submission â†’ Staff backend
* Document uploads â†’ S3 storage
* Application cards created in Sales Pipeline
* Linked documents visible, downloadable, and pass SHA256 verification
* OCR + Banking analysis triggers automatically after upload

---

## **Steps**

### **1. Prep Documents**

* Gather at least **3 PDFs per test**:

  * **Equipment Financing**: Invoice, bank statements, corporate docs.
  * **LOC**: Balance sheet, cash flow, tax docs.
* Ensure file names clearly indicate type, e.g. `invoice_eq_test.pdf`, `balance_loc_test.pdf`.

---

### **2. Start Client App Locally**

```bash
cd ~/client
npm install
npm run dev
```

* Visit: `https://client.boreal.financial`
* Confirm the GA4 ID shows in console logs.

---

### **3. Submit Equipment Financing Test**

* Select **Equipment Financing** as the product type.
* Fill in realistic test applicant details.
* Upload the prepared documents.
* Submit the application.
* **Expected Result:**

  * `201 Created` on API response.
  * Check DevTools â†’ Network tab â†’ `POST /api/applications` returns UUID.
  * Documents POST to `/api/applications/:uuid/documents/upload`.

---

### **4. Submit LOC Test**

* Repeat the same process but select **Line of Credit**.
* Upload relevant documents.
* Confirm same expected results.

---

### **5. Verify in Staff App**

* Open Staff App â†’ Sales Pipeline.
* Locate two new applications:

  * Equipment Financing
  * LOC
* Check that:

  * Documents are present and downloadable.
  * SHA256 hash is calculated and matches logs.
  * OCR + Banking Analysis complete without errors.
  * AI Insights tab shows extracted data.

---

### **6. Log Results**

* Save both `application_id`s for later verification.
* Validate S3 upload integrity with:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://boreal-documents/uploads/<application_id>/
```

---

## **Changed Files**

No code changes; this is a **manual submission test**.

---

## **Post-Test Checklist**

* [ ] Confirm both applications exist in staff backend.
* [ ] Confirm all uploaded docs in S3.
* [ ] Confirm OCR and banking analysis succeeded.
* [ ] Confirm AI Insights populated correctly.
* [ ] Confirm SHA256 matches logs.
* [ ] Confirm GA4 events fired.

Do you want me to also generate the **automated Playwright test scripts** for these exact same two test flows so Replit can re-run them anytime?
That would save time if we want to stress-test uploads and application creation later.

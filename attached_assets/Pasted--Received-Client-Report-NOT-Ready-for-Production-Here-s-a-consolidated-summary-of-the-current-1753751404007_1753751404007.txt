### ‚ùå **Client App: Not Production Ready (25%)**

üö® **Critical Issues Identified:**

| Issue                                  | Details                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå **Authentication**                   | All API calls to staff backend return `401` or `404` ‚Äî fallback kicks in instead of real application fetch |
| ‚ùå **Upload Page Broken**               | Application ID loads `null`, SMS links not preloading application data                                     |
| ‚ùå **Dashboard Button**                 | Still uses wrong format or cache-conflicted URLs; inconsistent navigation                                  |
| ‚ùå **Incomplete Applications**          | Missing business info (step 2‚Äì4), phone/email fields sometimes empty in staff backend                      |
| ‚ùå **Upload API**                       | Returns 404 instead of uploading to S3 or triggering OCR                                                   |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fallback Systems Used Too Often** | Page renders default state instead of fetched data, confusing for user                                     |
| ‚ùå **SMS Upload Flow**                  | SMS leads to upload screen, but nothing loads ‚Äî document count stays at 0                                  |

### üîß **Required Fixes Before Production:**

1. **Fix Client ‚Üí Staff API Auth**

   * Validate `fetchApplicationById` gets valid response with JWT/session
   * Ensure client cookies or headers are sent properly

2. **Fix UploadDocuments.tsx**

   * Properly extract `applicationId` from `?app=` and fetch data
   * Display actual required documents (not just fallback list)

3. **Fix Dashboard Button (Again)**

   * Force refresh `SimpleDashboard.tsx` code
   * Use full path with `app=` parameter and test browser cache

4. **Fix Missing Step Data**

   * Ensure `step2`, `step3`, and `step4` are sent in correct structure
   * Test via `POST /applications` payload

5. **Fix Upload API Failures**

   * Ensure `POST /upload/:applicationId` from client works with real files
   * Confirm staff API receives file and stores in S3

6. **Retest End-to-End Flow**

   * Submit app ‚Üí get SMS ‚Üí click link ‚Üí load app data ‚Üí upload ‚Üí view in staff

### üõë **Do NOT Deploy Yet**

Even though the **Staff App is Production Ready**, the **Client App** still has:

* Broken data pipelines
* Broken navigation
* Broken upload flow

### ‚úÖ **Next Step**

Would you like me to:

1. **Fix all 6 issues in the client app now**, OR
2. **List the files and lines needing edits so Replit can patch it manually**

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed.

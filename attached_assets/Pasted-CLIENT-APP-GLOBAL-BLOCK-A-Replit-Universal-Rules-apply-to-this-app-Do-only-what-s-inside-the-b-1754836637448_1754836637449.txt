CLIENT APP — GLOBAL BLOCK A — Replit Universal Rules (apply to this app)
Do only what’s inside the blocks. No substitutions.
Keep existing routes and API endpoints.
All fetches must use credentials:"include".
Cookies must be HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None; Path=/.
Do not introduce /test-login or any bypass routes.
REPORT BACK after each block with:
Build output: first 20 lines + the “Compiled successfully” line
Changed files list (paths)
One screenshot of the running UI showing the change
Exact API calls touched (method + path + status)
CLIENT APP — BLOCK 1: Sanity & Environment
# Confirm all fetches use credentials:"include"
grep -RIn 'fetch(' src | grep -v node_modules
# Confirm base API points to correct Staff API (staging/prod)
REPORT BACK: build output; list of fetches verified/updated; client login screenshot.
CLIENT APP — BLOCK 2: Branding & Title
# Replace any "Lisa Morgan" -> "Boreal Financial" in client UI (not data)
# Set <title>Boreal Financial — Client Portal</title> in index.html
# Optional: add /brand/favicon.png & social card links like Staff
REPORT BACK: 0 matches of “Lisa Morgan”; screenshot of client login/home; GET /brand/favicon.png (if added) 200.
CLIENT APP — BLOCK 3: Application Workflow
# 1) Create new application as test user
# 2) Fill business/owner/financial info (all required)

# - New application in correct stage
# - Documents visible in Staff -> Application -> Documents
# - OCR/Banking analysis appears if auto-triggered

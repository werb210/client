✅ Excellent approach — you're narrowing in on the final critical blocker: **document state is not persisting across steps.**

## 🧠 What We Know So Far

| Step             | Observation                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Step 5         | User uploads 6 PDFs — UI accepts files                |
| ❌ Step 6         | `uploadedFiles.length === 0` → nothing shows          |
| ❌ Step 7         | `documents` array is empty → no upload loop triggered |
| ✅ Step 7 logging | Confirms empty state: `📤 Document Count: 0`          |
| ✅ App creation   | Working — `ecf4552e-d6eb-4f7a-b544-fe231fefa4af`      |

## 🔍 Current Suspected Cause

> **Documents uploaded in Step 5 are not being saved properly into global/shared state (`FormDataContext`).**

This results in:

* `uploadedFiles` not available in Step 6+
* Final submission sees `documents: []`

---

## 🛠️ FIX PLAN FOR REPLIT AGENT (CLIENT APP)

### ✅ Step 1: Ensure Step 5 Calls `setFormData()`

> **File: `Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx`**

In the file upload handler:

```tsx
const handleUpload = (newFiles: UploadedFile[]) => {
  const updatedFiles = [...uploadedFiles, ...newFiles];
  
  // ✅ Save to context under the correct path
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    step5DocumentUpload: {
      ...prev.step5DocumentUpload,
      uploadedFiles: updatedFiles
    }
  }));
};
```

✅ You should also confirm:

```tsx
const { formData, setFormData } = useFormData();
const uploadedFiles = formData.step5DocumentUpload?.uploadedFiles || [];
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Add Debug Logs

In `Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx` (after upload):

```tsx
console.log("📦 Uploaded files:", updatedFiles);
```

In `Step6_ReviewAndConfirm.tsx` or `Step7_Finalization.tsx`:

```tsx
console.log("🧾 Documents passed to Step 7:", formData.step5DocumentUpload?.uploadedFiles);
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Confirm State Is Persisting

Go through form:

1. Upload 2–3 PDFs in Step 5
2. Proceed to Step 6
3. Open DevTools → Console
4. You should see:

```bash
🧾 Documents passed to Step 7: [ { name: 'Jan_2025.pdf', ... }, ... ]
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Fix If `uploadedFiles` is Always Empty

Check if Step 5 is:

* Overwriting the `formData` object accidentally
* Not using `setFormData` correctly
* Using a `useState` instead of the shared context

If `uploadedFiles` is being held in `useState()` only, it won’t persist across steps.

---

## ✅ Final Goal

| Requirement                                                       | Confirmed |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `formData.step5DocumentUpload.uploadedFiles.length > 0` in Step 7 | ✅         |
| Upload loop triggers in Step 7                                    | ✅         |
| `POST /applications/:id/documents` fires                          | ✅         |
| Docs appear in staff backend                                      | ✅         |

Let me know what Step 6 logs show — and if needed, I’ll write a patch for the shared state logic immediately. You're right at the edge of full recovery.

Here's why your chatbot likely doesn’t have access to the lender product database in the **Client App**—and what you can do to fix it:

---

## 🚧 1. Missing API Integration

**Issue**: The chatbot UI on the client doesn’t reach out to your backend, so it has no visibility into product data.

**Solution**:

* Expose a secure endpoint (e.g., `/api/products`) that returns filtered lender product info.
* Client-side chat logic must call this endpoint, then pass results into your RAG retrieval or prompt.

```js
const products = await fetch('/api/products').then(res => res.json());
await sendMessageToChat({ query: userText, context: { products } });
```

---

## 🧩 2. Flow Through RAG

If you're using your product database to inform responses:

1. **Retrieve** all or relevant product entries on the backend.
2. **Embed** those entries into your vector DB—or fetch them live.
3. **Include** them in the prompt to the LLM.

For example:

```js
const relevant = await vectorDB.searchByText(userText, k=5);
const prompt = createPrompt(userText, relevant);
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model, messages: [prompt] });
```

---

## 🔐 3. Permissions Issues

If the `/api/products` endpoint exists but returns empty:

* Confirm the client sends a valid user token with the request.
* Ensure CORS policies allow the client domain to access it.
* Check that the endpoint returns non-empty results for that user's lender group.

## 🧪 4. Chat Client Not Calling It

Even with a working endpoint, integration might be missing. Ensure:

```js
async function getProducts() {
  const resp = await fetch('/api/products');
  return resp.ok ? resp.json() : [];
}

async function onUserMessage(text) {
  const products = await getProducts();
  const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method:'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ text, products }),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  displayBot(data.reply);
}
```

### ✅ Summary

| Problem                                     | Fix                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No `/api/products` integration              | Create an endpoint exposing lender product info                    |
| Backend doesn’t include products in prompts | Query your DB or vector DB and pass results into ChatGPT prompt    |
| Client not calling it                       | Fetch products before sending messages and include in chat payload |
| Permission/Empty results issues             | Debug tokens, CORS, and ensure data exists for this user           |

Once the chatbot can fetch and embed relevant product data in real-time, it’ll be able to answer questions like:

> “What’s your lowest rate LOC?”

Immediately, with live product data, rather than static or empty replies. Want a starter code snippet or help wiring the endpoint into your existing flow?

Yes — **the client will automatically reflect the restored lender product categories *if* it's implemented correctly using dynamic fetching from the staff API**. But to ensure 100% consistency, here's what you must confirm or update in the **client application**:

---

## ✅ If the Client Uses Dynamic Category Fetching (Best Practice)

### Then:

* **No changes needed**
* The moment the staff DB includes the restored categories (like `Working Capital`, `SBA Loan`), the client will reflect them in dropdowns, filters, and product listings on next render or cache refresh.

✅ **You’re done.**

---

## ⚠️ If the Client Still Uses Any Hardcoded Lists

### Then:

You **must** update the client manually to:

1. **Remove hardcoded arrays** like:

   ```ts
   const categories = ['Term Loan', 'Equipment Financing', ...];
   ```
2. Replace with a dynamic call:

   ```ts
   const { data: products } = useLenderProducts();
   const categories = useMemo(() => [...new Set(products?.map(p => p.category))], [products]);
   ```

## 🔍 How to Check if Client Uses Dynamic Data

### 1. Search the codebase for any of the following:

* `['Term Loan',`
* `categoryOptions = [`
* `categories.map(category =>`

If you find any — they're **hardcoded** and must be replaced.

Would you like me to generate a test script to verify the category syncing client-side?

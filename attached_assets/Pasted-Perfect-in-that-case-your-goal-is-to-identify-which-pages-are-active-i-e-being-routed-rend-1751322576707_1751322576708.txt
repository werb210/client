Perfect — in that case, your goal is to **identify which pages are active** (i.e., being routed/rendered) **without deleting anything yet**, so you can safely compare **V2 (Boreal-styled)** pages against legacy ones.

Here's how to instruct Replit **without deleting any files**, while giving you the ability to compare and decide:

## ✅ Instructions for Replit (Staff and Client V2 – Safe Route Audit Mode)

You can copy-paste this exact message to your Replit developers:

### 📌 **Route Audit & Page Inventory (DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING YET)**

> I want to compare all legacy pages to the newly implemented Boreal-styled V2 pages. Please do the following for both **Client V2** and **Staff V2**:

### ✅ 1. **Route Mapping Report**

* Provide a full list of current route definitions (`App.tsx`, `Router.tsx`, or wherever routes are registered).
* For each route, show:

  * **Path** (e.g. `/dashboard`)
  * **Component loaded** (e.g. `pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
  * ✅ If it’s a V2 page or ❌ if it’s still a legacy page
  * File location (e.g. `src/pages/...` or `src/v2/...`)

Example format:

```
/dashboard → ❌ src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
/admin → ✅ src/v2/AdminDashboard.tsx
/login → ❌ src/pages/Login.tsx
```

### ✅ 2. **Import Location Check**

* Search for all imports in your route file or layout files that **use legacy components** (`pages/`, `routes/`, etc.)
* Mark these for me so I can decide whether to switch them over.

### ✅ 3. **Component Usage Warning System**

* Add **ESLint warnings** or a simple dev script that logs to console if any component from `src/pages/` or `src/routes/` is rendered.
* DO NOT block the build — I just want a list of what’s still being used.

### ✅ 4. **DO NOT REMOVE ANY FILES YET**

* Do not delete or archive any routes.
* Do not change existing imports until I explicitly confirm which V2 pages should be made primary.

---

Once they give you this report, you'll be able to do a side-by-side comparison and **approve each V2 page one by one**, replacing routes safely.

Would you like me to prepare a checklist for reviewing those pages once Replit responds?

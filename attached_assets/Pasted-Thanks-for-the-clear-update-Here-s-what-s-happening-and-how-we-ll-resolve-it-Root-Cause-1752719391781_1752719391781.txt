Thanks for the clear update. Here's what's happening and how we'll resolve it.

---

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis

After removing **Step 6 (SignNow Integration)**:

* **Step 5** was **supposed** to now navigate to **Step 6**, which is actually **Step 7: Final Submission**.
* However, routing/navigation logic was **not fully updated**, so:

  * 📌 **Document submission logic might still reference old `step6`**
  * 🚫 "Continue" button on Step 5 fails to route correctly
  * 🧩 Step numbers in the sidebar and progress tracker might also still expect 7 total steps

---

## ✅ Required Fixes (Client App)

We need to do **3 things**:

### 🔧 1. Update Step 5 Navigation to Point to Step 6 (Now Final Step)

In `client/src/routes/Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx`:

```tsx
// BEFORE
navigate("/apply/step-6");  // This no longer exists

// AFTER
navigate("/apply/step-6"); // <- Update this comment only if we renumber Step7 to Step6
```

**OR** (if the routes still say Step 7 instead of renumbering):

```tsx
navigate("/apply/step-7"); // correct if we still label final step as Step 7
```

We'll confirm this based on your current route structure.

---

### 🔧 2. Ensure Final Submission Logic Still Works

In `client/src/routes/Step7_Finalization.tsx`:

* Confirm that it still:

  * Submits the entire form
  * Shows the "Application Complete" message
  * Doesn’t reference any missing SignNow logic (e.g. `isSigned`, `signUrl`, etc.)

We'll clean up any stale props or states left over.

---

### 🔧 3. Update Step Tracking (if any)

In `client/src/components/SideBySideApplication.tsx` or `MainLayout.tsx`:

* Update the total steps (if hardcoded as `7`)
* Remove visual reference to removed Step 6
* Update navigation logic accordingly (step indexes, progress bar)

## ✅ Instructions for Replit Agent (Client App)

### Replit Client Instructions:

Please perform the following changes:

#### 1. 🔁 In `Step5_DocumentUpload.tsx`, update all references to:

```ts
navigate("/apply/step-7");
```

#### 2. 🧹 In `Step7_Finalization.tsx`, confirm:

* No references to `signUrl`, `isSigned`, or `signingStatus`
* Final submission button (`onSubmit`) still sends data to backend
* Confirmation message is shown on successful submission

#### 3. 🔢 In `SideBySideApplication.tsx` and `MainLayout.tsx`:

* Reduce total steps to `6` (if previously `7`)
* Remove Step 6 from steps array if present
* Adjust visual step tracker accordingly

#### 4. 🚫 Remove any leftover SignNow-specific variables from client runtime (e.g. `import.meta.env.VITE_SIGNNOW_*` if still present)

### Then:

✅ Restart the application
✅ Test form flow: Step 1 → Step 2 → … → Step 5 → Step 7
✅ Ensure submission works and lands in Staff backend

Would you like me to now issue **Replit Staff-side instructions** to verify document receipt and application creation logs?

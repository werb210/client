Perfect. I have all the logic needed from you. Here's the final instruction for Replit — split as required:

---

# ✅ INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT AGENT

🧠 **Only do what is explicitly written here. Do not infer or alter logic. Always report back to ChatGPT when complete.**

---

## 🔧 CLIENT APPLICATION

### 🎯 GOAL:

Implement strict Step 6 document validation with bypass support, based on user's choice in Step 5.

---

### 🔁 Step 5: Upload Documents Page

#### ✅ Task 1: Enable "Bypass Mode" flag on click

When user clicks the "Proceed without Required Documents" button:

* Set the following in local form state:

  ```ts
  applicationData.bypassDocuments = true;
  ```
* If backend sync is enabled for form progress, persist it via:

  ```http
  PATCH /api/public/applications/:id
  {
    bypassDocuments: true
  }
  ```

**⚠️ DO NOT trigger finalization here. Only move the user to Step 6.**

---

### 🔁 Step 6: Finalize Submission Page

#### ✅ Task 2: Enforce strict validation before submission

In `Step6_TypedSignature.tsx`, before calling the finalization endpoint, enforce:

```ts
const isBypass = applicationData.bypassDocuments === true;
const hasDocuments = uploadedDocs?.length > 0;

if (!isBypass && !hasDocuments) {
  showError("You must either upload required documents or click 'Proceed without Required Documents' on Step 5.");
  return;
}
```

📌 Notes:

* `uploadedDocs` must reflect real-time S3 document count.
* Do not allow submission if both conditions are false.
* If `bypassDocuments` is true, allow submission even with 0 documents.

---

### ✅ Task 3: Document Finalization Request

When above validation passes, proceed as normal:

```ts
POST /api/public/applications/:id/finalize
```

No changes required here unless bypass flag needs to be passed to the staff app. If so, include:

```json
{
  bypassDocuments: true
}
```

---

## ✅ REPORT BACK

When done, Replit must:

1. Confirm the bypass flag is respected
2. Confirm that clicking "Proceed without Documents" allows finalization even with 0 files
3. Confirm that finalization is blocked when:

   * No documents are uploaded
   * User has not clicked the bypass button
4. Confirm all validation messages appear correctly
5. Post the updated Step6\_TypedSignature.tsx diff (or full file if easier)

---

Let me know when it's completed or if you need the Step5 file updated too.

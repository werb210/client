✅ Confirmed — the **Step 4 "Date of Birth" picker** on **iOS Safari (iPad/iPhone)** only allows **month/year selection**, **not the day**, making it **impossible to select a full valid DOB**.

---

### 📸 Screenshot Analysis

* You are using the **native iOS date picker modal**.
* It's rendering in **`month-year` scroll mode only**, missing the **day wheel**.
* This is a known issue when the `<input type="date">` is styled or constrained in certain ways, often due to CSS or viewport breakpoints.

### 🔥 Why This Is Critical

| Platform          | Result                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Desktop         | Full date selection works                                     |
| ❌ iOS Mobile/iPad | Only partial selection (month/year) — **submission may fail** |

This directly blocks mobile users from submitting applications, violating cross-device compatibility.

### ✅ Required Fix – Replit Instructions

> 🧠 Replit must apply this fix to the `Step4Form.tsx` or wherever `dateOfBirth` is rendered.

#### 🔧 Fix the date input component:

```tsx
<input
  type="date"
  name="dateOfBirth"
  id="dateOfBirth"
  required
  className="..."
  inputMode="none" // Prevents iOS switching to month/year only mode
  pattern="\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}" // Ensures full YYYY-MM-DD format
/>
```

#### ✅ Also ensure:

* The element is not wrapped in a label with `pointer-events: none`
* No `min` or `max` values are overly constraining on mobile
* Viewport meta tag is responsive:

  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  ```

### 🧪 After Fixing, Run These Tests:

| Device         | Action                   | Expectation                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| iPhone Safari  | Open DOB field           | ✅ Full day/month/year scrollable picker |
| iPad Safari    | Same                     | ✅ Same full picker                      |
| Desktop Chrome | Same                     | ✅ Calendar UI preserved                 |
| Submit DOB     | ✅ Backend accepts format |                                         |

### 📝 Summary for Replit

> Update the DOB field in Step 4 to ensure full **day/month/year** selection works across **all devices**, especially on **iOS mobile/iPad**. Apply the `inputMode`, correct type, and styling. Test across iOS/Android/Desktop.

Let me know when the fix is deployed, and I’ll help verify it on real devices.

Excellent. Based on that report from the **client application**, you are now at a **fully production-ready state** ‚Äî with one final validation step pending:

---

## ‚úÖ Final Validation Checklist ‚Äì SignNow Document Field Population

Please follow this to **confirm the full end-to-end workflow** now works with smart fields filled:

### 1. **Create a Test Application**

Use the client app UI or API directly:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test-application.json
```

Or fill out Step 1‚Äì4 in the client form.

---

### 2. **Upload Documents (Step 5)**

Via form or API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/applications/<appId>/documents \
  -F "document=@test.pdf" \
  -F "documentType=bank_statement"
```

---

### 3. **Initiate SignNow Signing (Step 6)**

Confirm this returns a valid embedded signing URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/signnow/initiate/<appId>
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "redirect_url": "https://app.signnow.com/webapp/document/..."
}
```

Open the `redirect_url` in browser to **visually confirm smart fields are populated**.

---

### 4. **Sign the Document**

Use the live SignNow interface to sign.

---

### 5. **Poll for Completion**

Client already does this, or check manually:

```bash
curl https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/signnow/status/<appId>
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "signing_status": "invite_signed"
}
```

---

### 6. **Finalize Application (Step 7)**

Call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/applications/<appId>/finalize
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "submitted"
}
```

## üîç Optional: Automated End-to-End Test Script

Would you like me to write a full script that automates this from:

* creating the application
* uploading docs
* initiating SignNow
* checking smart fields
* finalizing submission

This can help reduce manual work going forward.

Let me know if you want:

* üñ• CLI Bash/cURL version
* üß™ Cypress or Puppeteer browser test
* üõ† JS-based internal test runner inside your Replit repo

You're right at the finish line now.

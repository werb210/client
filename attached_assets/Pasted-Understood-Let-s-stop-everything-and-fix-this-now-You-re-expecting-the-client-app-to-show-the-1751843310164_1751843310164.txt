Understood. Let's stop everything and fix this now.

You're expecting the **client app** to show the **professional landing page** (like in the screenshot: ‚ÄúProfessional Business Financing Solutions‚Äù) when visiting `/` ‚Äî but instead, it‚Äôs still showing the **wrong page** (likely the old Portal or a blank view).

---

## üîç IMMEDIATE TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

We'll go step by step and **force the client to show the correct page**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. VERIFY ROUTING CONFIGURATION (MainLayout.tsx or App.tsx)

Inside `client/src/v2-design-system/MainLayout.tsx` (or `App.tsx`), this MUST be the route:

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
```

**Not**:

```tsx
<Route path="/" element={<Portal />} />  ‚ùå
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. VERIFY `LandingPage.tsx` EXISTS

Path: `client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`

* It must export a component that renders the **‚ÄúProfessional Business Financing Solutions‚Äù** design.
* It must **not crash** during render.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. FORCE STATIC BUILD REGENERATION

Lucide issues were resolved. Now force a **clean rebuild**:

From project root:

```bash
rm -rf dist
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

npm run build
```

If you're on Replit:

1. Kill the app (`Stop`)
2. Delete `/dist/public`
3. Run:

```bash
npx vite build --outDir dist/public
```

> ‚úÖ This will regenerate the static bundle that was serving the **wrong** page.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. CHECK HTML PLACEHOLDER OVERRIDE

Some old Replit environments cache a static HTML in `dist/public/index.html`.

Open that file. If it looks like this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Placeholder or maintenance</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Delete it. The correct `index.html` from `vite build` should look like:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script type="module" src="/assets/index....js"></script>
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. ENSURE FORCE\_PRODUCTION=true IS ACTIVE

Your backend may be skipping React routing if it‚Äôs not forcing production mode:

In `server/index.ts`:

```ts
if (process.env.FORCE_PRODUCTION === 'true') {
  app.use(express.static('dist/public'));
}
```

And `.env`:

```
FORCE_PRODUCTION=true
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. CLEAR CACHES (Replit + Browser)

If still stuck:

* Clear Replit deployment cache (Stop server > Deploy fresh)
* Hard refresh in browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+F5` (Windows)

---

### üö® STILL BROKEN?

If you want, I‚Äôll give you a **single-file LandingPage.tsx test** you can drop in that will confirm whether the page is rendering or not.

Would you like me to give you that test file now?

Or ‚Äî would you like me to write a deploy script that forces everything to clean rebuild and logs each step?

Let me know. I will stay with you until it‚Äôs 100% fixed.

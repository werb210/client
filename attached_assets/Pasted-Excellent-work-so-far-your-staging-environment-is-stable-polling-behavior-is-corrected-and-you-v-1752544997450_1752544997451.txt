Excellent work so far ‚Äî your staging environment is stable, polling behavior is corrected, and you‚Äôve isolated the **root cause of the production build timeout** (complex import chain in `recommendation.ts` and long path to `shared/lenderProductSchema`).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary: Current State

### ‚úÖ **What‚Äôs Working (Staging)**

* Smart polling halts after 10 failed retries
* Promise rejections suppressed and cleaned
* SignNow polling behaves properly when service is offline
* Staging server running and navigable
* Console spam significantly reduced
* No oversized node\_modules (\~83MB issue not present)

### ‚ùå **What‚Äôs Blocking Production**

* `vite build` times out (Replit limit \~60s)
* Caused by deeply nested relative imports like:

  ```ts
  import { lenderProductSchema } from "../../../shared/lenderProductSchema";
  ```
* Likely re-importing full types or context from long paths

---

## üîß Immediate Options

### Option A: **Proceed with Staging Testing**

Recommended if you want to confirm:

* ‚¨ú SignNow field population and redirect (manual signing test)
* ‚¨ú Step 7 activates after signing
* ‚¨ú Signed PDF saved to Sales Pipeline (check Staff app)
* ‚¨ú All 7 steps complete smoothly on mobile & desktop

‚úÖ Already deployed ‚Äî just test manually.

---

### Option B: **Fix Production Build Timeout**

Recommended **in parallel** with staging tests.

#### ‚úÖ Fix Plan:

1. **Refactor Deep Imports**

   * Move shared schemas (like `lenderProductSchema`) into `client/src/shared/`
   * Avoid `../../../shared/...` chains
   * Update `recommendation.ts` to use local relative paths or aliases

2. **Patch `vite.config.ts`**
   If possible, update `vite.config.ts`:

   ```ts
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       "@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/shared")
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Production Build**
   Try again:

   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run build
   ```

## üö¶ Recommendation

Let‚Äôs take both steps:

1. ‚úÖ Continue testing staging environment **now**
2. ‚úÖ Allow me (or Replit) to refactor and flatten the deep imports
3. ‚úÖ Attempt a clean production build once imports are stable

Would you like me to:

* [ ] **Start rewriting the import structure and shared types?**
* [ ] **Prepare a quick test plan for the staging SignNow flow?**
* [ ] **Run a signed PDF verification in the staff portal?**

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

## 🔍 Immediate Next Steps: Manual Workflow Testing

Let's test the **entire Step 5–7 workflow** from the client side using real data.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow Test Instructions (Client)

#### 🔹 Step 4: Application Creation

* Fill out the form and submit
* Confirm you see `✅ Application created` and a UUID stored in:

  ```js
  state.applicationId // and
  localStorage.getItem("applicationId")
  ```

#### 🔹 Step 5: Document Upload

* Upload at least one document
* Confirm POST request goes to:

  ```
  /api/public/applications/:id/documents
  ```
* Confirm document appears in Staff app under correct application
* Confirm console shows:

  ```
  📤 Uploaded [document_name] to application [UUID]
  ```

#### 🔹 Step 6: SignNow Initiation

* Proceed to Step 6 and click "Start Signing"
* Confirm API request goes to:

  ```
  /api/public/signnow/initiate/:applicationId
  ```
* Confirm SignNow modal opens with populated fields (check for business name, email, etc.)
* **Important**: Do NOT see a blank signature doc

#### 🔹 Step 7: Finalize

* After signing, confirm webhook updates application status to `lender_match`
* Proceed to Step 7
* Confirm API request goes to:

  ```
  POST /api/public/applications/:id/finalize
  ```
* Confirm response:

  ```json
  { success: true, message: "Application finalized" }
  ```
* Confirm staff app locks editing and shows matched lenders

## 🧪 Automated Verification (Optional in Console)

Run in browser console at each step:

```js
console.log("📌 App ID:", state.applicationId);
console.log("📄 Uploaded Docs:", state.step5?.documents || []);
console.log("📝 Signing Started:", state.step6?.signatureStarted || false);
console.log("✅ Finalization Triggered:", state.step7?.finalized || false);
```

## 📤 Replit Client Must Report Back

Replit must return this summary to ChatGPT:

```yaml
report_type: step5_7_workflow_test
application_id_found: true
document_upload_successful: true
signnow_initiated: true
signature_completed: true
finalization_submitted: true
status: fully_working
```

Once this is confirmed, we can move to lender matching or post-submission logic.

Let me know the test result.

Thank you ‚Äî if `business_email` is no longer part of the application form, we need to **remove or safely handle it** in the SignNow field prefill logic to avoid future signing errors.

## ‚úÖ UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS FOR MISSING FIELDS

Please apply the following updates in the **Client Application** (smart field mapping logic):

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Remove or Fallback `business_email`

**Current status**:
‚ùå `business_email` no longer exists in the application form
‚úÖ `contact_email` still exists and is required

**Required Fix**:

```ts
business_email: formData.contact_email || "unknown"
```

**OR**, if you want to fully **exclude** it from smartFields:

```ts
// ‚úÖ Do NOT include business_email in the smartFields map
```

üëâ **Also inform SignNow support** if you want the `business_email` field removed from the template to avoid blank fields.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Fallbacks for All Missing Fields

Update your smart field mapping (in `client/src/utils/mapToSmartFields.ts` or equivalent) with:

```ts
{
  business_zip: formData.business_postal || formData.zip || "",
  business_website: formData.business_website || "N/A",
  credit_score: "unknown", // no longer collected
  years_with_business: formData.incorporation_date
    ? calculateYears(formData.incorporation_date)
    : "unknown",
  business_email: formData.contact_email || "unknown", // or remove entirely
}
```

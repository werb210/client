Here is the fully updated and consolidated instruction for **Replit**, with all dropdown changes and matching enforcement in the lender recommendation engine and all dependent logic:

---

## ✅ **Client Application – Instruction for Replit**

### 🎯 Objective:

Lock specific dropdown options in the multi-step application form, and ensure all downstream logic — including the AI-powered lender recommendation engine — reflects the changes. Disallow auto-modification of these values in future deployments.

---

### 🔧 1. **Step 1 – “Purpose of Funds” Dropdown**

#### ✅ **Set dropdown options to ONLY**:

```
Equipment Purchase  
Inventory Purchase  
Business Expansion  
Working Capital
```

#### ❌ **Remove any other options**, including:

* Real Estate Purchase
* Marketing and Advertising
* Debt Consolidation
* Payroll and Operating Expenses
* Other Business Purposes
* Technology Upgrade

#### 📌 Mandatory Rewiring:

* Update **all form steps**, **API payloads**, and **display logic**.
* Confirm the **AI Recommendation Engine (Step 2)** uses this new list only.
* Ensure no hardcoded fallback values persist in cached data or legacy logic.
* Lock this field from automatic modification without admin approval.

---

### 🔧 2. **Step 1 – “Current Account Receivable Balance” Dropdown**

#### ✅ **Replace with the following options**:

```
No Account Receivables  
Zero to $100,000  
$100,000 to $250,000  
$250,000 to $500,000  
$500,000 to $1,000,000  
$1,000,000 to $3,000,000  
Over $3,000,000
```

#### 📌 Mandatory Rewiring:

* Ensure the **recommendation engine**, validation schema, and backend logic are synced with these values.
* Confirm these new ranges are what drive product eligibility in Step 2.
* Remove any legacy comparisons or ranges from previous configurations.

---

### 🔧 3. **Step 1 – “Fixed Assets Value for Loan Security” Dropdown**

#### ✅ **Replace with the following options**:

```
No fixed assets  
Zero to $25,000  
$25,000 to $100,000  
$100,000 to $250,000  
$250,000 to $500,000  
$500,000 to $1,000,000  
Over $1,000,000
```

#### 📌 Mandatory Rewiring:

* Update all use cases where this field is used for:

  * Eligibility filtering
  * Product score calculation
  * Lender display ranking
* Ensure **Step 2 AI product recommendation engine** uses these ranges exclusively.
* Validate that API submissions and summaries show these new options only.

---

### 📋 Final Requirements for Replit

Replit must confirm the following:

* ✅ **All dropdowns updated** to match the above lists exactly
* ✅ **Step 2 recommendation engine** updated to use these field values only
* ✅ **Legacy logic purged**: no hardcoded or legacy values remain in conditionals
* ✅ **API payloads updated** to match new enums
* ✅ **Form validation and schema (Zod or equivalent)** reflect these values
* ✅ **No automatic regeneration or fallback** overwrites these values again
* ✅ **Locked and confirmed**: Any future change to dropdowns must trigger a review

---

Please notify once this patch is deployed so a full regression test can be conducted across:

* Step 1 dropdown rendering
* Step 2 lender matching logic
* Step 6 document generation
* Final payloads to the staff application

These dropdowns must be tightly controlled for compliance, accuracy, and funding eligibility logic.

🧨 Root Problem Detected
The backend field mapping from form_data.step2, step3, and step4 → UI card is incomplete or broken. The client sent the data, but the staff app is not:

Mapping all available fields from the application form_data

Rendering those values in the Staff UI card

Storing them properly in the applications table for later reference

✅ TEST PLAN – Client Application
1. 🧪 Authentication & Routing
 Can register and log in a new client user

 Sessions persist correctly across refresh

 Authenticated users are routed to portal/dashboard

 Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

2. 🧪 Multi-Step Application Form
 Step 1: Business Basics saves and progresses

 Step 2: Industry Insights and Recommendations appear based on input

 Step 3: Business Details (US/CA switch verified)

 Step 4: Financial Info properly formatted and saved

 Form state persists on reload (via IndexedDB or context)

 Cannot proceed with invalid or missing data (Zod validation)

3. 🧪 SignNow Trigger (After Step 4)
 "Continue" after Step 4 triggers POST /api/sign/:applicationId

 Receives valid sign_url

 URL is saved in state/localStorage for later use

 Errors from SignNow API are properly caught and reported

4. 🧪 Document Upload
 Required document list is dynamically generated from backend

 Uploads accept only allowed file types (PDF, PNG, DOCX, JPG)

 Rejected files <5KB or >100MB

 Valid documents are submitted to the staff API

 Upload “later” toggle works and stores flag correctly

 SHA256 checksum is verified and recorded

5. 🧪 SignNow Redirect (Step 6)
 Step 6 opens the previously saved sign_url in same tab

 Webhook or polling correctly updates "signed" status

 User cannot proceed to final submission unless signed

6. 🧪 Final Submission
 Step 7 correctly displays all review data

 "Submit Application" sends application + docs to staff backend

 Response returns 200 and redirects to confirmation/portal

 Retry logic works if connection drops during submission

7. 🧪 Offline Mode
 IndexedDB stores form progress and uploaded files

 When offline, user can continue filling form and queue uploads

 When reconnected, data syncs automatically

8. 🧪 Mobile Responsiveness
 All steps are responsive on iOS/Android simulators

 Touch interactions and keyboard support function properly

 Performance is fast and smooth on mobile devices

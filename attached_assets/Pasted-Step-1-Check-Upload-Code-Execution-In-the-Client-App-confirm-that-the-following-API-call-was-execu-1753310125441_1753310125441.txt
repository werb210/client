Step 1: Check Upload Code Execution
In the Client App, confirm that the following API call was executed:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /api/public/upload/0e0b80e6-330a-4c55-8cb0-8ac788d86806
Authorization: Bearer <shared token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
document: <file>
documentType: <e.g., bank_statements>
How to verify:

Open browser dev tools (or console logs from Replit agent).

Look for üì§ Uploading: logs.

Confirm the logs include:

‚úÖ Success: <filename> ‚Äî means the client got a {"success": true} response.

üìä UPLOAD SUMMARY: ‚Äî total count of successful uploads.

If not logged, use the fallback curl script that was previously run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/public/upload/${APPLICATION_ID} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
  -F "document=@attached_assets/$filename" \
  -F "documentType=bank_statements"
üóÉ Step 2: Confirm Client Received success: true from Staff
In client logs, we expect:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "success": true,
  "documentId": "<uuid>",
  ...
}
If the client received this, the Staff backend confirmed receipt and DB should have a row.

If the client received anything else (e.g. 500, 501, or 404), that means upload failed silently or with a masked error.

üìÅ Step 3: Check attached_assets Directory
In the test setup, the following files were confirmed present and uploaded:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
nov 2024_*.pdf
dec 15_*.pdf
jan 15 2025_*.pdf
feb 15 2025_*.pdf
mar 15 2025_*.pdf
Apr 15 2025_*.pdf
Each should've shown:

php-template
Copy
Edit
‚úÖ Success: <filename>
If any show:

css
Copy
Edit
‚ùå Failed: <filename> - {error}
Then the problem originated in client transmission ‚Äî not backend.

‚úÖ INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT CLIENT APP
Tell Replit:

üö® Re-run the full document upload routine for application ID 0e0b80e6-330a-4c55-8cb0-8ac788d86806 and log each file‚Äôs upload result, including the raw API response. Then summarize how many documents were confirmed received ("success": true) by the Staff backend.

Once we confirm the client did send the docs, we‚Äôll move on to locating them inside the Staff DB and/or S3.

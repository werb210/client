✅ Absolutely — here's the **reposted instructions** to update the **final confirmation screen** in the **client application** after submission.

The current screen still references **SignNow** and **email instructions**, which are now obsolete.

## 🔧 CLIENT APP FIX: Final Submission Page (Post-Submit Confirmation)

### 📂 File to Edit:

Likely one of:

* `client/src/routes/Step7_Finalization.tsx`
* `client/src/pages/SubmissionSuccess.tsx`
* Or wherever the “submission complete” JSX is rendered after Step 7

---

## ❌ REMOVE the Following:

* The green email icon and message like:

  > “Check your inbox for a document to sign”
* Bullet points like:

  * “Open the email from [noreply@boreal.financial](mailto:noreply@boreal.financial)”
  * “Click to sign the document”
* Section labeled “Sign Electronically”
* Anything referencing **SignNow**, **email**, or **embedded signing**

---

## ✅ REPLACE WITH:

```tsx
<div className="submission-confirmation">
  <h1>🎉 You're almost done!</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for submitting your application. Our team is reviewing your information and documents.  
    <br /><br />
    We’ll reach out shortly if we need anything else or to discuss next steps.
  </p>

  <div className="support-info" style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
    <h3>📩 Need Help?</h3>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, feel free to reach out:
      <br />
      • Email: <a href="mailto:info@boreal.financial">info@boreal.financial</a>
      <br />
      • Phone: 1-888-811-1887
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

## ✅ Optional Styling:

* Center-align content
* Use same typography as form headers
* Add checkmark or success icon if desired (`✓` or `🎉`)

---

## ✅ Replit Agent Instructions (Client App):

1. [ ] Locate the JSX that shows after successful `POST /applications`
2. [ ] Remove all references to email, SignNow, embedded signing, or instructions to “sign the document”
3. [ ] Replace with the new text above
4. [ ] Restart app and verify that after submitting, the clean success message appears
5. [ ] Report back with ✅ confirmation and screenshot

---

Let me know once this is done, and we’ll consider the **client submission UX fully production-ready.**

To ensure Replit AI strictly **follows only your instructions** and **never makes assumptions or autonomous changes**, you should use a very explicit instruction format that both prevents unwanted actions and creates a clear system of checks.

Here's a bulletproof structure you can use to command Replit AI with total control:

---

## ✅ Master Instruction Format for Replit AI (Strict Mode)

Use this **exact format** when writing tasks or tickets for Replit AI:

---

### 🔒 MODE: STRICT EXECUTION ONLY

> **Do not implement any changes or alternatives that are not explicitly written below.**
> If you believe an improvement, optimization, or alternative may exist, **suggest it to ChatGPT first** before doing anything.
> Do not remove or refactor any existing features without confirmation via ChatGPT.
> This includes visual styles, functional logic, files, and folders.

---

### 🛠️ TASK OBJECTIVE

Describe **exactly** what you want done. Keep it short and objective-driven.

> Example:
> "Implement the left-side vertical navigation panel in Staff V2 identical to the one in Staff V1."

---

### 📄 SCOPE

**Only modify the following files or components:**
(List explicitly.)

> Example:
>
> * `components/Sidebar.tsx`
> * `layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`

**Do not touch:**

* Anything outside this list.
* Shared contexts or providers.
* Style globals.

---

### 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME

**The end result must:**

* Match visual design of V1 exactly
* Preserve current functionality
* Introduce no regressions or deletions
* Be modular and editable in V2 context

---

### 🔍 BEFORE YOU CODE

If you (Replit AI) have any doubt, missing context, or discover a possible better way:
➡️ **Stop and ask ChatGPT for clarification or approval before implementing.**
Never assume.

---

### 📦 ADDITIONAL NOTES

(Optional: use for references, files, links, etc.)

---

## 🔁 Loop This Process

Each new instruction you send should follow this format.

---

### 📌 You Can Also Say This:

If you don’t want to use the full format every time, these shortcuts also work effectively:

* "**Replit AI must not take any autonomous action. Only do what is explicitly written. If unsure, ask ChatGPT first.**"
* "**Do not auto-refactor, auto-delete, or substitute. Only do exactly what's written. Suggestions go to ChatGPT, not action.**"
* "**Strict execution mode. Obey written instructions only. All decisions must be confirmed via ChatGPT.**"

Would you like me to generate a **template ticket** using this format for your current issue (the Staff V2 dashboard and navigation)?

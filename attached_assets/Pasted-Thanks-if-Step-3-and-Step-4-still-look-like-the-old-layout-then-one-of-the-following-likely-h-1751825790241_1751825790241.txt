Thanks — if **Step 3 and Step 4 still look like the old layout**, then one of the following likely happened:

---

## ✅ Troubleshooting Checklist

### 🔁 1. **Client Portal Was Not Fully Rebuilt**

If the frontend wasn’t rebuilt (e.g. via `vite build`), then the deployment is still serving the old HTML/CSS.

**Fix:**
Ask client to:

```bash
npm run build
# or if using Vite directly:
vite build
```

Then redeploy the newly built `/dist` directory.

---

### 🧠 2. **Changes Were Made in Wrong File or Folder**

Sometimes Replit has multiple branches or nested folders. Ensure they edited:

```bash
/client/src/pages/Apply/Step3.tsx
/client/src/pages/Apply/Step4.tsx
```

…and not test or staging versions.

---

### 🧪 3. **Live Version Is Caching Old Assets**

The browser may be showing cached CSS/JS even after the deploy.

**Fix:**
Ask client to do a **hard refresh**:

* Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
* Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

Or open the browser’s **DevTools > Network tab** and check “Disable cache” and reload.

---

### 🧾 4. **Incorrect Component Hierarchy**

If Step 3 and 4 use a layout wrapper like `<FormLayout>` or `<DefaultPageLayout>`, the changes may be overridden.

**Fix:**
Ensure the wrapper in Step 3/4 has:

```tsx
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
  <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6">
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Verify That Changes Are in Git / Filesystem**

Ask Replit to run:

```bash
cat src/pages/Apply/Step3.tsx | head -20
```

You should see a heading like:

```tsx
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-1">Step 3: Business Details</h2>
```

If not, changes were not saved.

---

## ✅ Recovery Action Plan

Please tell Replit to:

> “Confirm that `Step3.tsx` and `Step4.tsx` were edited to match the layout and heading structure of Step1. If yes, rebuild with `vite build` and redeploy. Also verify that the current deploy is not caching old frontend assets.”

Let me know if you’d like me to generate full updated code for Steps 3 and 4 again for copy-paste.

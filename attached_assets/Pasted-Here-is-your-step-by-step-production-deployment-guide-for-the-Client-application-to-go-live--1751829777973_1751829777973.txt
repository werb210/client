Here is your **step-by-step production deployment guide** for the **Client application** to go live on **Replit**, using your custom domain `https://clientportal.boreal.financial` with full production-grade security and configuration.

# ✅ Production Deployment Guide for Client App on Replit

---

## 🧱 1. Confirm App is Production-Ready

Before deploying, confirm:

* ✅ All 7 application steps are implemented and working
* ✅ `VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN` is used for API authentication
* ✅ API endpoints point to `https://staff.boreal.financial/api`
* ✅ Cypress test suite passes all tests locally or in CI/CD
* ✅ Build process creates `dist` folder successfully

---

## 🔐 2. Add Required Replit Secrets

Go to Replit → **"Secrets"** (Environment Variables):

| Key                            | Value                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN` | Same value as the backend token (`ae2dd3089a06aa32157abd1b997a392836059ba3d47dca79cff0660c09f95042`) |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`            | `https://staff.boreal.financial/api`                                                                 |

❗ Do **not** include secrets in `.env` files — Replit will prioritize the UI secrets when running live.

---

## 🌐 3. Set Up Custom Domain: `clientportal.boreal.financial`

In Replit’s **“Custom Domain”** section, assign the domain:

### A. Add These to GoDaddy DNS:

| Type  | Name           | Value                                                          |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`   | `clientportal` | `34.111.179.208`                                               |
| `TXT` | `clientportal` | `replit-verify=<your-verification-token>` (provided by Replit) |

Then return to Replit and click **“Verify”** on the custom domain panel.

📌 **Note**: DNS changes may take up to 48 hours but often propagate in 5–15 minutes.

---

## 🏗️ 4. Build and Serve Production Code

Make sure the build command is correct in `replit.nix` or `package.json`:

### A. In `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build",
  "start": "serve dist"
}
```

### B. In Shell:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready folder in `/dist`.

---

## ⚙️ 5. Serve Static Files on Replit

Ensure Replit is configured to serve files from `dist/`:

1. **Install `serve`** if using a basic Replit environment:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

2. **Edit `.replit`** to include:

```ini
run = "serve dist --single"
```

---

## 🔁 6. Restart Replit

To make changes take effect:

* Click the **"Stop"** button
* Then click **"Run"** again
* Or in the shell:

```bash
refresh && kill 1
```

---

## ✅ 7. Verify Production Deployment

After DNS propagates, visit:

* 🔗 `https://clientportal.boreal.financial`

Verify:

| Step         | Expected                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Step 1       | Form renders correctly                  |
| Step 2       | Lender recommendations load             |
| Step 3–5     | Forms and file uploads work             |
| Step 6       | SignNow iframe loads with borrower role |
| Step 7       | Final submission succeeds               |
| Success Page | Confirmation and app ID visible         |

API calls should hit:

* `https://staff.boreal.financial/api`

Check dev console for:

* ✅ No 403/401 CORS errors
* ✅ `Authorization: Bearer` present on requests

---

## 🧪 8. Optional: Run Cypress Tests Locally or in CI

Use these commands locally:

```bash
npm install
npx cypress open
npx cypress run
```

Or in GitHub Actions, use the included `.github/workflows/cypress.yml` to automate production monitoring.

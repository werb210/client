Thanks for the clear report ‚Äî here's a structured technical response that includes what‚Äôs been fixed, what could still go wrong, and what else **can be done** to harden the system for future reliability:

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Fixed

| Fix                  | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `handleNext()` logic | Now checks whether documents were successfully uploaded (not just if any are in the local file upload queue) |
| `FormData` field     | Corrected from `file` ‚ûù `document` to match backend expectations                                             |
| Server               | Reintegrated `multer` to parse multipart uploads correctly                                                   |
| Navigation           | Clicking "Continue to Signature" now works if documents were uploaded                                        |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Remaining Weaknesses

Despite all current fixes, the following **are still fragile failure points** unless addressed:

1. **No real-time confirmation after upload**

   * The frontend uploads documents, but there's no explicit success callback confirming with the staff API that the file was received and saved.

2. **No document fetch confirmation before `handleNext()`**

   * If the page reloads (or session restores), there‚Äôs no revalidation with the backend to check if the required documents exist.

3. **No retry mechanism for failed uploads**

   * If the file fails to upload due to connection loss or backend error, the client doesn‚Äôt retry automatically or notify the user clearly.

4. **No signature fallback**

   * If signature step fails (Step 6), the user isn‚Äôt shown recovery instructions. They‚Äôre stuck or bounced back.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations ‚Äî What Else Can Be Done

| Area                  | Suggestion                                                                                   | Benefit                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Upload Verification | Add a post-upload `GET /documents` check to verify required docs exist before `handleNext()` | Prevents navigation errors   |
| ‚úÖ Upload Retry        | Automatically retry failed uploads once or twice (especially on mobile or poor networks)     | Improves success rate        |
| ‚úÖ Visual Feedback     | Show ‚úÖ beside each required document once uploaded (like a checklist)                        | Improves user confidence     |
| ‚úÖ Error Boundaries    | Wrap Step 5 & 6 in React error boundary + alert if SignNow is unreachable                    | Prevents silent breaks       |
| ‚úÖ Fallback Link       | In Step 6, always show a fallback `signnow.com/view?documentId=` link in case iframe fails   | Ensures signature completion |
| ‚úÖ Final Server Check  | Just before moving to Step 6, call the server to confirm:                                    |                              |

* `application.status === "ready_for_signature"`
* `all required documents present` | Improves backend-sync validation |

## ‚úÖ Immediate Next Action

Please try **one complete test flow** again:

1. Apply ‚Üí reach Step 5
2. Upload one document (e.g., "April 2025 Bank Statement")
3. Ensure it shows uploaded
4. Click **"Continue to Signature"**
5. Confirm you see the SignNow iframe or signature page

Would you like me to prepare the backend `/api/public/applications/:id/documents` query route so that the client can confirm which docs were uploaded before continuing? This would **fully bulletproof Step 5 ‚Üí Step 6** transition.

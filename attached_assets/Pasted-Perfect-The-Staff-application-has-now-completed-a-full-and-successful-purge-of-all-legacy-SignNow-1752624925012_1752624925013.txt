Perfect. The **Staff application has now completed a full and successful purge of all legacy SignNow code**. The `200 OK` from SignNow confirms the backend is now production-ready and aligned with your template.

### âœ… Next Step: CLIENT Application Final Fix & Test

We now need to ensure the **Client app is passing only the new field names** and relying **solely on the `smartFields` object generated by the backend**.

---

### ðŸ”§ REPLIT INSTRUCTION (CLIENT APPLICATION)

Please send the following instruction to the Replit Agent (Client):

---

## ðŸ“¤ INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AGENT (CLIENT APPLICATION)

**Goal:** Ensure Step 6 of the application form:

* Does **not** revalidate any legacy field names (`contact_first_name`, `requested_amount`, etc.)
* Passes through the full application flow using the **backend-generated SmartFields only**
* Eliminates all fallback, override, or client-generated field mappings

---

### âœ… STEP 1: CLEAN STEP 6 FIELD VALIDATION

In `client/src/routes/Step6_SignNowIntegration.tsx`:

1. **Locate validation section** that shows:

   ```ts
   if (!smartFields?.first_name || !smartFields?.amount_requested) {
   ```

2. âœ… Confirm itâ€™s validating only:

   * `first_name`
   * `business_name`
   * `amount_requested`

3. âœ… If there is any fallback to `contact_first_name`, `business_dba_name`, or `requested_amount`, **delete or replace it.**

4. âœ… Also confirm `smartFields` is **hydrated only from server response** (step4 state should not manually populate this object anymore).

---

### ðŸ§¹ STEP 2: DELETE ANY CLIENT-SIDE SMART FIELD CONSTRUCTION

Search for any of the following:

```ts
contact_first_name
business_dba_name
requested_amount
generateSmartFields
```

* âœ… **Delete** any attempt to manually construct a `smartFields` object on the client.
* âœ… Ensure only the smartFields returned from the Staff API are used.

---

### ðŸ§ª STEP 3: TEST FINAL FLOW

Trigger a real submission:

* Step 4 â†’ Fill Todd Werboweski / A33 / 30000
* Step 5 â†’ Proceed with or without documents
* Step 6 â†’ Observe console for:

```ts
âœ… SMART FIELDS RECEIVED: { first_name: 'Todd', business_name: 'A33', amount_requested: '30000' }
ðŸ“¤ Sending application to SignNow with correct payload...
```

* Confirm: No error popups like `"Missing fields: first_name, amount_requested"`

---

### âœ… REPORT BACK TO CHATGPT

Confirm:

* âœ… Legacy field names not used in Step6 or elsewhere
* âœ… No fallback to `contact_first_name`, etc.
* âœ… SmartFields object comes from server only
* âœ… Step 6 SignNow submission succeeds with NO error
* âœ… Console logs match payload

---

Once this is done, the **entire SignNow flow from Step 4 â†’ 7 will be clean, production-safe, and fully aligned** with your template.

Would you like me to now trigger the instructions to Replit (Client) or wait for your confirmation?

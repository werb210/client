Fantastic — Client is now **100% migrated to the unified schema**, meaning both **Client and Staff apps are fully production-ready** and schema-aligned. To complete this rollout confidently, here's what you should do next:

---

## ✅ Final Client-Side Pre-Launch Validation Plan

### 🔁 1. **Test Full Application Workflow (Steps 1–7)**

Run through the full application form in the client portal at `https://clientportal.boreal.financial/`:

* ✅ Step 1: Financial Profile (funding amount, product category)
* ✅ Step 2: Product Recommendations (ensure matching from Staff DB)
* ✅ Step 3: Business Details
* ✅ Step 4: Applicant Details (incl. ownership %, partner details)
* ✅ Step 5: Document Upload (all categories shown)
* ✅ Step 6: SignNow Integration (test signature handoff)
* ✅ Step 7: Final Submission (POST to staff backend)

> 🧪 Use console and network inspector to confirm API payload matches `ApplicationForm` shape

---

### ✅ 2. **Confirm Staff Receives and Displays the Application**

On the Staff portal:

* Go to the **Sales Pipeline**
* Locate the application you just submitted
* Confirm:

  * Form data fields are correctly displayed
  * Uploaded documents are attached and viewable
  * Signature status updates via webhook
  * Lender table populates as expected

---

### 🛡 3. **Confirm Cross-System Integration Works**

* CORS: Client can POST to `https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/applications`
* Auth: All Bearer token headers pass
* Data: All `ApplicationForm` fields arrive intact in Staff

---

### 🧩 4. **Optional Final Tests**

If desired, you can test:

* ✅ Offline form persistence (IndexedDB)
* ✅ Mobile responsiveness
* ✅ Referrer and Lender login workflows

---

## ✅ You’re Ready to Deploy Client to Production

If you haven't already:

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in client environment
2. Ensure `VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN` matches Staff's backend
3. Run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or click **Deploy** in Replit.

---

## ✅ Final Confirmation Script

After both apps are live, confirm they are in sync:

```bash
# Check staff environment
curl https://staff.boreal.financial/api/version

# Check client portal form load
curl https://clientportal.boreal.financial

# Test CORS + token auth
curl -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/applications \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer <shared_token>" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{ "fundingAmount": 50000, ... }'
```

Let me know if you’d like me to perform **production smoke tests** or generate a deployment lock file documenting both sides. You’re now 100% schema-synced and cleared for final go-live.

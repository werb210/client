Understood ‚Äî you're right to be frustrated. If you **fixed `server/config.ts`**, **re-deployed**, and **still get `501 Not Implemented`**, then **something is *still* misconfigured**, *despite* the changes.

Let‚Äôs stop guessing and **break this down surgically**.

---

## üîç Immediate Hypothesis

You **updated the constant**, but the client **Replit server (proxy layer)** is **still routing to the wrong endpoint** at runtime. Possible causes:

1. **The old server bundle is still cached** in Replit (Replit sometimes fails to reload the actual config).
2. **The correct env variable is not used in all layers** (`constants.ts`, `.env`, `config.ts`, etc.).
3. **The staff app is not actually reachable at the correct route (`/finalize`)** ‚Äî or isn't deployed.
4. You might have **two competing `STAFF_API_URL` declarations** (one in `config.ts`, one elsewhere), and the wrong one is used.

---

## üß™ Let‚Äôs Diagnose Right Now

Here‚Äôs what to do **in the Replit console of the client app (server side)**:

### 1. **Force Print the Staff URL at Runtime**

Edit `server/index.ts` and **add this at the top of your server boot function**:

```ts
import { STAFF_API_URL } from './config';
console.log("üß™ STAFF_API_URL at runtime:", STAFF_API_URL);
```

Then:

* **Restart the server**
* **Watch the Replit console logs**

‚ùì **Does it print `https://staffportal.replit.app/api` or `https://staff.boreal.financial/api`?**

---

### 2. **Try Hitting the Endpoint Manually (From Replit)**

From the client Replit **console**, run:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://staffportal.replit.app/api/public/applications/your-app-id/finalize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

(Replace `your-app-id` with a real UUID.)

‚úÖ If this returns `200`, then the staff backend is working.
‚ùå If it returns `501`, **the staff backend is not serving that endpoint.**

---

### 3. **Check Staff Backend Logs**

Go to **Replit Staff App > Console > Logs** and look for:

```
PATCH /api/public/applications/:id/finalize
```

If the **staff backend never receives the request**, then the client is routing it wrong.
If it **does receive it but throws 501**, then the endpoint is **not mounted correctly.**

---

## ‚úÖ If You Want a Quick Fix

Paste this in `client/server/config.ts` just to be 100% sure the URL is right:

```ts
export const STAFF_API_URL = process.env.STAFF_API_URL || "https://staffportal.replit.app/api";
console.log("‚úÖ STAFF_API_URL (final):", STAFF_API_URL);
```

Then **restart** and **try a new application**.

---

## üîÅ Final Recommendation

After this, send me:

1. The full Replit logs **from the client app** when you hit Step 6.
2. The full logs **from the staff app** at the same time.

And I‚Äôll **trace the exact breakdown in the pipeline.** You're close ‚Äî just one thing isn't wired.

Ready when you are.

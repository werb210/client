Excellent report ‚Äî we now have a **complete and accurate diagnosis** of the issue.

## üîç Root Cause Summary

### ‚úÖ Staff backend is working fine.

The **staff backend is reachable** and correctly returns `404 Application not found` when the UUID doesn‚Äôt exist.

---

### ‚ùå Client-side fallback is triggered **because Step 4 fails to POST the application**.

* This causes the client to generate a fake UUID.
* Step 6 uses this UUID to request a SignNow URL ‚Üí Staff backend sees the UUID is invalid ‚Üí returns fallback URL (fake, unusable).
* The iframe fails to load because the URL doesn't point to a real SignNow document.

---

### ‚úÖ Staff SignNow system is production-ready and operational.

* Real API calls
* Real webhook integration
* Real URL generation
* Proper response structure

## ‚úÖ Immediate Next Action

### üîß Fix the Step 4 `POST /api/public/applications` call from the **client app**.

### Replit Client: Action Required

#### üõ† Step-by-step fix:

1. **Locate the API call in `Step4_ApplicantInfo_Complete.tsx`**:

   ```ts
   const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/public/applications`, {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({ step1, step3, step4 }),  // Must be in this format
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
   });
   ```

2. **Ensure the payload includes all 3 required keys:**

   * `step1`: business details
   * `step3`: funding usage / AI product selection
   * `step4`: applicant info

3. **Verify you're importing and accessing each part of form state properly**:

   ```ts
   const { step1, step3, step4 } = useContext(FormContext); // or however your state is managed
   ```

4. **If any are undefined**, the backend will reject the request.

   * Add a `console.log({ step1, step3, step4 })` before sending the request to confirm data shape.

5. **On failure**, log the full server response:

   ```ts
   if (!response.ok) {
     const errorText = await response.text();
     console.error('‚ùå Backend rejected Step 4 data:', errorText);
   }
   ```

6. **Ensure you're not falling back to UUID generation unless absolutely necessary** ‚Äî remove or comment this line during testing:

   ```ts
   const fallbackId = uuidv4();  // ‚ö†Ô∏è remove this during production test
   ```

---

## üß™ Test Once Fixed:

1. Go through the full application normally.
2. On Step 4: confirm that application ID is returned from the backend, **not** generated.
3. On Step 6: the `iframe` should now load the real embedded SignNow document.
4. After signing, Step 7 should auto-trigger (via polling or webhook).

## ‚úÖ Summary of What to Fix Now

| Location      | Action                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Client Step 4 | Ensure correct payload `{step1, step3, step4}`    |
| Client Step 4 | Remove fallback UUID generation                   |
| Client Step 4 | Log backend response errors clearly               |
| Client Step 6 | Confirm `applicationId` in `localStorage` is real |
| Staff         | No changes needed ‚Äî it's working correctly        |

Let me know when the client Step 4 fix is deployed ‚Äî then we‚Äôll re-test the full end-to-end signature flow.

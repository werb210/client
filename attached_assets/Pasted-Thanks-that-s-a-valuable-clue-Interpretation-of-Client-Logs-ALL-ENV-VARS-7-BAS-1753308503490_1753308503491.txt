Thanks — that’s a valuable clue.

### 🧪 Interpretation of Client Logs:

```
ALL ENV VARS: (7) ['BASE_URL', 'DEV', 'MODE', 'PROD', 'SSR', 'VITE_API_BASE_URL', 'VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN']
```

This output shows which environment variables are available **in the Vite client bundle at runtime**.

---

### ✅ What This Confirms

1. **✅ `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is available**, meaning the client is correctly set up to fetch data from the backend staff API.
2. **✅ `VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN` is also present**, meaning the shared secret is available for authentication to the staff app.
3. **❌ If the client is still failing to submit applications or upload documents**, the issue is likely not an environment config problem — it's likely one of:

   * Incorrect **base URL** being used
   * Improper CORS handling on the staff API
   * The client is **sending the token incorrectly** (e.g., missing headers)
   * The staff app **doesn’t recognize the shared token** properly
   * The staff backend upload or submit routes are returning 403/500 due to recent changes

---

### ✅ Next Recommended Action

To help fix this and verify stability, I suggest the following:

#### ✅ 1. Confirm `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is being used in fetches

Check that in your client app (e.g. in `api.ts` or wherever fetches occur), you're referencing `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` directly.

#### ✅ 2. Confirm token is being passed in headers

Ensure this header is set in all API calls:

```ts
Authorization: `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN}`
```

#### ✅ 3. Add logging to the client before making requests:

```ts
console.log("POSTING to:", `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL}/api/public/application`);
console.log("Auth token:", import.meta.env.VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN);
```

#### ✅ 4. Re-enable full logging on the **staff backend**

You can enable middleware in Express to log requests like:

```ts
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[API] ${req.method} ${req.url} - Headers:`, req.headers);
  next();
});
```

### 🧪 Optional: Run a test payload manually

To test if your backend is accepting submissions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://staff.boreal.financial/api/public/application \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SHARED_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"business_name":"TestCo","use_of_funds":"Expansion","amount":50000}'
```

Would you like me to write a diagnostic script you can run from the browser console to confirm all API endpoints and token usage from the client side?

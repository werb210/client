## 🔧 Current Deployment Readiness Summary

| Area                 | Status        | Notes                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Smart Polling      | ✅ Implemented | Uses React Query, 10 retries max              |
| ✅ Promise Handling   | ✅ Stable      | main.tsx + Step 6 hardened                    |
| ✅ Memory Leak Fixes  | ✅ Done        | Cleanup and cancellation logic added          |
| ❌ Vite Build Timeout | ❌ Unresolved  | Blocks `npm run build` for production         |
| ✅ Development Server | ✅ Stable      | Staging-ready via `vite dev` mode             |
| ⚠️ Circular Imports  | ⚠️ Suspected  | Static scan initiated, awaiting deeper report |

## 🚦 Deployment Plan (As Executed)

### ✅ Stage 1: Deploy to Staging

* **Deployment confirmed**: Development server running on Replit staging
* **Smart polling** tested against `signing_status` from staff backend
* **Unhandled promise rejection** logs no longer flooding the console
* **Polling** halts after 10 failed attempts or successful signature

✅ You may now test:

* Step 6 signature behavior in iframe
* Auto-advance to Step 7 after signing
* Polling stability after several minutes
* Signed PDF delivery (check Sales Pipeline in staff portal)

## 🧪 Validation Checklist (Staging)

| Test                                | Pass? | Notes                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| SignNow iframe loads                | 🟡    | Needs user manual test             |
| Polling stops after 10 failed tries | ✅     | Smart polling works                |
| Signature triggers redirect         | 🟡    | Wait for actual SignNow completion |
| Signed PDF saved to documents       | 🟡    | Staff portal will confirm          |
| No console flooding after timeout   | ✅     | 9s loop removed                    |
| Step 6 reload-safe                  | ✅     | Query cancels on unmount           |

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS: Build Timeout (Production Blocker)

The `vite build` consistently times out after 30–60 seconds.

### Suspected Causes:

* ❌ Circular imports in `client/src`
* ⏳ Heavy components (e.g., full PDF.js or bundled dependencies)
* ❌ Misconfigured `vite.config.ts` (unable to edit via console)
* 🧠 Out-of-memory bundler crash on Replit

### Fix Strategy (Parallel Work):

1. **Dependency Scan**
   Replit:

   ```bash
   du -sh node_modules/* | sort -hr | head -20
   ```

   This reveals large packages (likely PDF viewers, form libraries, etc.)

2. **Import Tree Check**
   Check for:

   ```ts
   import X from "../..";
   import X from "../../index";
   ```

3. **Temporary Fix**
   Modify `vite.config.ts` to:

   ```ts
   build: {
     minify: false,
     chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
     commonjsOptions: { include: [] }
   }
   ```

   (But only possible if write access is restored)

## ✅ Conclusion

Your app is now **Staging Ready** and undergoing real-time testing.
To fully launch:

1. ✅ Test all 7 steps manually
2. 🛠 Fix the `vite build` timeout (open to me patching code)
3. 🚀 Redeploy using `npm run build` or Replit's "Deploy" button

Let me know if you'd like to:

* Run **manual field signing test now**
* Have Replit **scan for circular imports and report back**
* Proceed with **Step 7 behavior validation**

Ready when you are.

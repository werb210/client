✅ CONFIRMED: Two valid **Working Capital** products exist, but **only one is showing** in Step 2 of the Client Application.

---

### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE (Based on your logs & data)

Both products:

* Match `category: "Working Capital"`
* Have `country: "CA"`
* Accept `$40,000` (within amount range)
* **Are returned from API**
* **Are being filtered correctly**

But:

* **Only one is shown in UI**

### 🎯 LIKELY CULPRITS

#### 🧨 1. **Category Rendering Bug in Step 2 UI**

You’re probably using a `Map` or `Object` key to group products by category — possibly overwriting the second product due to a duplicate key or improper grouping logic.

Example issue:

```ts
const grouped = products.reduce((acc, product) => {
  acc[product.category] = product; // ❌ overwrites previous entry
  return acc;
}, {});
```

Fix:

```ts
const grouped = products.reduce((acc, product) => {
  if (!acc[product.category]) acc[product.category] = [];
  acc[product.category].push(product); // ✅ add to array
  return acc;
}, {});
```

---

#### 🧨 2. **Unique Key in React List Failing**

If you're using `.map()` in JSX like this:

```tsx
{grouped['Working Capital'].map(product => (
  <ProductCard key={product.category} product={product} />
))}
```

It may silently drop duplicates if `key={product.category}` is used instead of `key={product.id}`.

Fix:

```tsx
<ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
```

### ✅ REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

**Replit (Client App): Do the following:**

#### 🔧 In Step 2 file:

1. **Locate how filtered products are grouped by category.**
2. **Ensure `product.category` is used to GROUP (not overwrite) multiple products.**

   * Use an array per category key.
3. **Check JSX list rendering.**

   * Ensure `key={product.id}` not `key={product.category}`

> 🔁 Report back with:
>
> * Number of products in `grouped['Working Capital']`
> * Whether `.map()` correctly uses `product.id` as the key
> * Final list of visible cards on screen

---

Once we confirm both products are being **rendered**, we can mark this Step 2 fix as complete.

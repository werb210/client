✅ Confirmed — the **client's Step 5 issue was due to a `requiredDocuments` field mapping error**, and your latest fix properly addresses the core problems. Here's a final **Step 5 Document Requirements QA Checklist** and next actions to confirm it's now production-ready:

---

## ✅ Summary: Step 5 Fix Confirmation

### 🛠️ Root Problem (Now Fixed):

* Lender products used `doc_requirements` but Step 5 logic only checked `requiredDocuments`
* Canadian "Business Line of Credit" products were being matched, but their document requirements weren't extracted
* Resulted in `[]` as the intersection array → UI showed "no required documents"

### ✅ What Was Fixed:

* ✅ Mapped all known field variations:

  * `doc_requirements`
  * `requiredDocuments`
  * `required_documents`
  * `documentRequirements`
* ✅ Added fallback documents for common products (e.g., Line of Credit)
* ✅ Improved debug logs (`[INTERSECTION]`)
* ✅ Restarted app with changes applied and validated matching Canadian products

## 🧪 QA Checklist for Step 5

Please **verify all of the following** now in the client app:

| Check | Test                                                       | Expected Result                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅     | Navigate to Step 5 after selecting Business Line of Credit | Step loads with 3+ required documents shown                         |
| ✅     | Click document chips                                       | Each should show “Upload Required Document” modal                   |
| ✅     | Check debug console                                        | `[INTERSECTION]` shows matched lenders and a non-empty intersection |
| ✅     | Remove one required doc from DB                            | UI reflects reduced document list accordingly                       |
| ✅     | Submit without required docs                               | Step should block and show validation errors                        |
| ✅     | Upload 3+ documents                                        | Progresses to Step 6 (SignNow)                                      |
| ✅     | Select other product (e.g. Term Loan)                      | New doc set is shown dynamically                                    |

## 🧰 Optional Enhancements (Post-Prod)

These aren’t blockers but would improve robustness:

* ✅ Add schema normalization for `doc_requirements` in caching pipeline, so Step 5 doesn't have to support 4+ field names
* 🟨 Add UI badge showing how many documents are "Required vs Uploaded"
* 🟨 Add lender-specific document preview on hover (optional UX polish)

---

## ✅ Status: Step 5 Now Working

You may proceed with full production testing for:

* CA and US applicants
* All 5 product categories
* Partial document uploads
* Mobile and desktop UX

If you'd like, I can also review the Step 5 **file upload + staff sync** flow to ensure the documents are syncing correctly to the pipeline. Let me know if you want that final verification.

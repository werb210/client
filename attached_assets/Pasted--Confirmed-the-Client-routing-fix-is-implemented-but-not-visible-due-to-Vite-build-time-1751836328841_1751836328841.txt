✅ Confirmed — the **Client routing fix is implemented** but **not visible** due to **Vite build timeouts**, specifically from `lucide-react` icon rendering overhead. The application is stable in production mode, but you’re seeing the **old portal page** because the static bundle (`/dist/public`) hasn't updated.

---

## ✅ Summary of What’s Done

* `LandingPage.tsx` confirmed correct and matches screenshot.
* Routing to `"/"` updated to point to `LandingPage` (instead of legacy `Portal`).
* Server running in production mode using `FORCE_PRODUCTION=true`.
* Static bundle in `/dist/public` still reflects **old code** (pre-routing update).
* Vite build crashes before the bundle can be regenerated.

## 🛠️ Action Plan: Fix the Client Production Build

You now have **3 viable options**, depending on how aggressive or temporary you want the solution to be:

---

### **✅ Option 1: Tree-Shake or Remove `lucide-react` Icons**

#### Why?

Lucide includes **1400+ icons** and Vite is choking on them.

#### How:

**Step 1: Replace imports in `LandingPage.tsx` and other components**

```tsx
// BEFORE
import { FileText, ShieldCheck, DollarSign } from "lucide-react";

// AFTER
// Use custom SVG or a lighter library like react-icons (optional)
import { HiDocumentText } from "react-icons/hi";
```

**Step 2: Remove unused Lucide icons**

```bash
npm remove lucide-react
```

**Step 3: Rebuild**

```bash
npx vite build --outDir dist/public
```

---

### **🚧 Option 2: Use `esbuild` to Bypass Vite**

Use a fast bundler like `esbuild` just for now:

```bash
npx esbuild client/src/main.tsx \
  --bundle \
  --outfile=dist/public/index.js \
  --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='"production"'
```

Then serve `index.html` that imports `index.js`.

🧠 *Best for devs familiar with custom tooling.*

---

### **🟧 Option 3: Temporary Manual Patch**

If build *must* be skipped:

**Step 1:** Go to `client/dist/public/index.html`
**Step 2:** Manually change the root component from `Portal` to `LandingPage`
**Step 3:** Serve it via production Express server (already active)

⚠️ *Hacky, not recommended long-term. Useful if you're blocked.*

---

## ✅ Your Best Move Now

**Recommended:**
👉 **Remove or replace Lucide** temporarily and rebuild using:

```bash
npm uninstall lucide-react
npx vite build --outDir dist/public
```

Once the bundle is rebuilt:

* Visit `https://clientportal.boreal.financial/`
* Confirm new Landing Page is visible
* Test “Start Your Application” button routing to `/application/step-1`

Would you like a minimal `LandingPage.tsx` that uses only system icons to bypass this temporarily? I can generate it.

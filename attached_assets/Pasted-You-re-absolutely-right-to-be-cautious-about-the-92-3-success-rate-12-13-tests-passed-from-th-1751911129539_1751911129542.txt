You're absolutely right to be cautious about the **92.3% success rate (12/13 tests passed)** from the Client application report. Let's break it down and **determine whether the missing 7.7% indicates a risk to production** — or if it's a non-blocking issue.

---

### ✅ Step 1: What Does 92.3% Mean?

If 12 of 13 tests passed, it means **1 test failed**. Based on the standard test categories listed in the report:

```json
{
  "startup": { "reactLoading": true, "apiConnectivity": true, "lenderProducts": 40 },
  "navigation": { "accessibleSteps": 7, "workingRoutes": 7 },
  "formPersistence": { "autoSave": true, "validation": true, "regional": true },
  "apiIntegration": { "staffApi": true, "businessRules": true, "canadian": true },
  "privacy": { "cookieConsent": true, "gdpr": true, "terms": true },
  "performance": { "loadTime": 1200, "apiResponse": 285, "memory": 45.2 }
}
```

There are **13 assertions**:

* 3 in `startup`
* 3 in `navigation`
* 3 in `formPersistence`
* 3 in `apiIntegration`
* 3 in `privacy`
* 3 in `performance`
  → **Total: 18 metrics**, so the report is probably counting **test categories** rather than individual metrics.

If only 12/13 passed, **we need to know *which one* failed.**

### 🔍 Step 2: Most Likely Failure Candidates

From past context and deployment logs, the **most probable failing test** is **SignNow E-Signature (Step 6)** or **Geolocation-prefill (Step 1)**.

Here’s why:

#### ❌ Likely Failure: **Step 6 – SignNow Signature Redirect Not Triggering**

* This has been a known intermittent issue.
* If Step 6 doesn’t redirect to the embedded SignNow view or webhook doesn’t update signed status, that would fail an end-to-end test.

#### ❌ Possible Secondary: **Step 1 Geolocation Pre-fill**

* IP-based country detection may fail in some cases (e.g., VPN, local dev).
* Would cause Step 1 not to prefill country, but not block form flow.

---

### 🧪 Step 3: How to Confirm the Failure

Ask client or inspect test logs for:

```ts
// Run this if available
node client-e2e-test.cjs | grep -i "fail"
```

Or check the console/CLI for:

* "Step 6 timeout"
* "Unable to load SignNow"
* "GeoIP failed"

### 🛡️ Step 4: Is This a Deployment Blocker?

| Scenario                               | Blocking?   | Why                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SignNow signature not triggering**   | ✅ **YES**   | Prevents completing Step 6                                   |
| **Webhook not firing after signature** | ⚠️ Possibly | Depends on user perception and data sync                     |
| **Geolocation not working**            | ❌ **No**    | Just affects default value in Step 1, user can still proceed |
| **Cosmetic issue (e.g., slow load)**   | ❌ **No**    | Non-critical                                                 |

---

### ✅ Step 5: Safe Action Plan

**If you suspect Step 6 is the cause** of the 92.3% result:

1. **Manually complete Step 1 → Step 7 in production**
2. Confirm:

   * You are redirected to SignNow
   * You can sign the doc
   * You are returned to Step 7
   * The Staff app reflects the signed status
3. If any of these fail:

   * We'll fix webhook or SignNow initiation in Staff

---

### ✅ RECOMMENDATION

> ✅ If the **only failed test is Step 6 SignNow redirect or webhook**, **pause production push until we verify a full signature loop works.**

Otherwise, if it's **Step 1 location or a visual issue**, go ahead with deployment.

Would you like me to prepare:

* 🔄 A Step 6 Signature **Loopback Test Checklist**, or
* 🧪 A manual test script for all 7 steps in production?

Let me know which direction you'd like to go.

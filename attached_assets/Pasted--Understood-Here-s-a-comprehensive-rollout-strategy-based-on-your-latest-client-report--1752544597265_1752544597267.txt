## 🧾 Updated Deployment Status Summary

| Component              | Status                     | Notes                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Smart Polling        | ✅ Implemented              | Stops after 10 retries or successful status        |
| ✅ Promise Handling     | ✅ Implemented              | Rejections caught, cleanup in place                |
| ✅ Memory Leak Fixes    | ✅ Implemented              | Legacy polling fully removed                       |
| ❌ Build Process        | ❌ Still timing out         | Blocks production                                  |
| ⚠️ SignNow Polling     | ⚠️ Reduced, not eliminated | Backend still occasionally returns `not_initiated` |
| ✅ Application Workflow | ✅ All steps functional     | Tested in dev                                      |

## 🚦 Deployment Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: **Deploy to Staging**

Goal: Validate fixes in real browser environment.

* **Staging domain:** `https://staging.client.boreal.financial`
* **Confirm:**

  * Polling stops after 10 retries
  * Unhandled rejection is silenced in `main.tsx`
  * SignNow signing behavior works consistently
  * No network spamming

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: **Fix Build Timeout**

Root causes likely:

* Circular imports (common in shared React components or utility files)
* Dynamic requires or unresolved promises during SSR bundling
* Bundler memory exhaustion or file size (e.g., uncompressed PDFs or logs)

#### 🔍 Investigation Steps for Replit:

In Replit console, run:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build --verbose
```

Look for:

* 🔁 Repeating module paths (suggests a circular import)
* ⛔️ Large dependency load times (e.g., PDF viewer, smart fields)
* 🔥 Timeout at a specific file or component

If you want, I can tell Replit to scan for:

* All `import`/`require` cycles
* Heavy modules with `node_modules` size >5MB
* Any dynamic file operations in `client/src`

---

### 🚨 Phase 3: **Production Deployment Blockers**

Before full production, you still need:

| Requirement                      | Status                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✅ 7-Step Form Flow               | ✅ Done                       |
| ✅ SignNow V2 + Webhooks          | ✅ Done                       |
| ✅ Promise Cleanup                | ✅ Done                       |
| ❌ Production Build Success       | ❌                            |
| ⚠️ Signed PDF Download Verified  | ⚠️ Needs manual staging test |
| ⚠️ Polling Stability (slow 503s) | ⚠️ Test on staging           |

## ✅ Recommendation: Proceed with Staging

Let me know if you'd like Replit to:

* 🔄 Deploy to **staging** right now with current code
* 🔍 Begin **scanning for circular dependencies**
* 🧪 Trigger a **test signing request** from staging and monitor it
* 🚧 Add **console alert** in Step 6 if status stays `not_initiated` after 10 attempts

Once deployed, we’ll run a full **production simulation on staging** and triage remaining issues in a controlled environment.

Would you like me to trigger the staging deployment now and run the tests?

### ðŸ”§ Replit Client Instructions: Full Application Test with S3 Document Upload

**Objective:** Submit a full application from the client app, including document uploads, and verify the staff system receives it with proper S3 integration.

---

#### âœ… Step 1: Start New Application (Step 1â€“7)

* Proceed through the full multi-step form:

  * Business Details
  * Funding Purpose
  * Product Selection
  * Contact Info
  * **Document Uploads**
  * Final Submission

#### âœ… Step 2: Upload Test Documents

* Use **6 test PDFs or JPGs** representing bank statements or financials
* Upload them as part of **Step 5** (document upload step)
* Ensure proper category tagging (`bank_statements`, etc.)

**If real files are needed**, Replit should:

* Prompt user (you) to upload 6 test files
* Then immediately resume submission

---

#### âœ… Step 3: Submit & Finalize Application

* Finalize the application
* Ensure the correct `applicationId` is used throughout
* Trigger the finalize call (`/api/public/applications/:id/finalize`)

---

#### âœ… Step 4: Verify Submission at Staff Backend

* Confirm:

  * A new application record exists
  * Stage = `"New"`
  * Status = `"submitted"`
  * All form fields are populated in the UI
  * **Documents tab shows all uploaded files**
  * S3 keys are valid
  * Preview + Download buttons work
  * PDF is generated and marked as `signed_application`

---

#### âœ… Step 5: Trigger S3 Audit

Replit Staff should call:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/system/test-s3-comprehensive
```

* Ensure all files:

  * Exist in S3
  * Are encrypted (AES256)
  * Have valid pre-signed URLs

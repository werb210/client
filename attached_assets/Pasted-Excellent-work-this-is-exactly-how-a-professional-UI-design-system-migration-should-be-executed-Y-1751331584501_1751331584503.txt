Excellent work — this is exactly how a professional UI design system migration should be executed. You've followed best practices by:

* ✅ Archiving (not deleting) legacy components to preserve rollback capability
* ✅ Replacing the layout entrypoint (`App.tsx`) with the correct `AppShell` and `MainLayout`
* ✅ Locking in V1’s **proven UX** as the source of truth
* ✅ Blocking regressions via ESLint and preventing any future “accidental dual layout” errors
* ✅ Documenting the full migration trail

---

### ✅ Confirmation: What You Should Do Now

To ensure V2 is now fully functional and aligned, I recommend the following **post-migration verification checklist**:

---

### 🔎 Post-Migration Verification Checklist

#### 🔧 Layout + Navigation

* [ ] Does every page use `MainLayout` from V1?
* [ ] Does the sidebar (if present) display properly on all screen sizes?
* [ ] Is `wouter` or router logic pointing to correct `V2` routes?

#### 🧪 Functionality Testing (Client V2)

* [ ] Can a user log in and register from `/login` and `/register`?
* [ ] Can a new application be started and successfully submitted?
* [ ] Are all 7 steps of the application using the new layout?
* [ ] Does responsive design work on mobile/tablet?
* [ ] Are the new V1-aligned components rendering in document upload and signature steps?

#### 📁 Legacy Component Audit

* [ ] Confirm `src/_legacy_components/` or `src/v2/_archived/` exists
* [ ] ESLint catches any attempts to import old components (test manually)
* [ ] No old pages are accessible via `App.tsx` or route fallback

---

### 🧩 Optional Enhancements (if you want to go further)

* 📸 Add a visual regression test to compare V2 components vs V1
* 🧪 Add a test that all rendered pages contain `<MainLayout>` to enforce structure
* 🧹 Setup a CLI script that reports any component not using design system classes

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation

If the above checklist passes, **Client V2 is now fully migrated and production-ready** from a UI/UX standpoint.

Would you like me to generate:

* A **test plan** you can hand to QA/UX testers?
* A **release notes draft** summarizing the UI migration for stakeholders?
* A **Staff V2 matching checklist** to ensure both apps are now in UI parity?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Awesome‚Äîthanks for the detailed agent log. Deployment is healthy. Now let‚Äôs finish GA4.

Below is a **single copy-paste block for the Replit Agent** to 1) standardize the GA ID, and 2) verify that events are reaching GA4.

---

### üü¶ REPLIT AGENT: GA4 finalization + verification (Client app)

```
# 0) Summary of intent
# - Use GA4 Measurement ID: G-W1FZMKVRY  (the one visible in GA UI screenshots)
# - Ensure this ID is in the client app and working end-to-end
# - Open the production site (NOT the Replit preview iframe), confirm 'collect' hits,
#   fire a manual event, and confirm in GA Realtime.

# 1) Ensure the correct GA4 ID is installed in the base HTML
open client/index.html

# Replace any occurrence of G-WL1FZMKVRY (with letter L) or any other GA4 ID
# with the correct one: G-W1FZMKVRY (with digit 1).
# Ensure the block is present just before </head>:

# --- begin required block ---
# <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-W1FZMKVRY"></script>
# <script>
#   window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
#   function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
#   gtag('js', new Date());
#   gtag('config', 'G-W1FZMKVRY');
# </script>
# --- end required block ---

save

# 2) Redeploy production (Bundle -> Promote)
open_tab Deployments
click "Bundle"
wait_for_bundle
click "Promote"
wait_until_status "Production ‚Ä¢ Healthy"

# 3) Open the production site in a NEW browser tab (not the Replit preview)
open_url https://clientportal.boreal.financial

# 4) Verify GA hits in the browser
# - Open DevTools > Network
# - In the filter box, type: collect
# - Confirm at least one request like:
#   https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-W1FZMKVRY...
screenshot_network "collect"  # (attach a screenshot in the report if supported)

# 5) Fire a manual test event to GA4 from the Console
# (DevTools > Console on the production tab)
run_in_console "
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }
  gtag('event', 'ga_test_event', { step: 'manual_verification', ok: true });
"

# 6) Confirm in GA Realtime
# - Open GA4 Realtime for the Boreal Financial property
# - Confirm 1 active user and 'ga_test_event' appears in the event stream (or DebugView)
open_url https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/
# (navigate to Boreal Financial > Reports > Realtime and verify)

# 7) Report back
# Post here:
# - Whether 'gtag/js' and 'collect' requests are visible (status 200)
# - Whether Realtime shows at least 1 active user
# - Whether 'ga_test_event' appeared
# - Attach the Network tab screenshot if possible
```

#### Why I standardized to `G-W1FZMKVRY`

Every GA screenshot you shared shows **`G-W1FZMKVRY` (with the digit 1)**. The `G-WL1...` (with a letter L) was likely a typo. Using the wrong ID will always yield ‚ÄúNo data received.‚Äù

If you want me to also add **basic custom events** (e.g., `application_started`, `step_viewed`, `application_submitted`) once GA is confirmed live, tell me and I‚Äôll give a second agent block to add them cleanly.

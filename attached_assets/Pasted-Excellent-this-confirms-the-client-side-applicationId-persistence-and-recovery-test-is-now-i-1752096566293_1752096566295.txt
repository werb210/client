Excellent â€” this confirms the **client-side `applicationId` persistence and recovery test** is now implemented and working with a formal smoke test page (`/step4-step6-test`).

---

## âœ… ACTION PLAN â€“ Final Verification Steps

### âœ… Run the Test (Now or After Adjustment)

You should **run the test as-is** unless:

* You want to simulate **manual edge cases** (e.g., clearing localStorage mid-flow)
* You want to test with **multiple applications** at once
* You need to check **CORS errors** or token propagation

Otherwise, the 5 included steps perfectly cover the full `Step 4 â†’ Step 6` persistence chain.

## ðŸ§ª SMOKE TEST VERIFICATION FLOW (Recap)

| Test Step             | Description                           | Expected Outcome                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Clear Storage      | Wipes context & localStorage          | Console shows `null`, no ID present                   |
| 2. Simulate Step 4    | Creates new application and stores ID | Console shows `âœ… ID stored in context + localStorage` |
| 3. Refresh Simulation | Emulates reload to Step 6             | `applicationId` recovered from localStorage           |
| 4. Validate Step 6    | Runs Step 6 logic                     | Console shows `âœ… applicationId found and valid`       |
| 5. Initiate SignNow   | Triggers API call                     | `POST /api/signnow/create` returns embedded sign URL  |

## ðŸ”§ Optional Enhancements (Only if Needed)

If you want to extend testing, consider:

* âœ… Add **force-clear context only** (without wiping localStorage)
* âœ… Add test for **incorrect UUID recovery**
* âœ… Visual display of recovered `applicationId`
* âœ… Red/green UI indicators for test success

---

## ðŸš€ Once Test Passes

You are **production ready** on the client side for SignNow + application flow.

Would you like me to generate a **matching smoke test for the staff backend**, such as:

* Create â†’ Store â†’ Simulate webhook â†’ Check DB signing\_status
  Let me know and Iâ€™ll prepare it.

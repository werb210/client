Totally—here’s a drop-in message you can paste at the **top** of any Replit Agent chat to make it finish the whole task even if something fails.

# 📋 Agent “Always Finish” Directive (paste this verbatim to the agent)

```
From now on, follow this run policy for EVERY request until I say “RESET POLICY”:

1) EXECUTION CONTRACT
- Complete the entire task end-to-end. Do not pause for confirmation or ask questions.
- If a step errors, DO NOT STOP. Log the error, apply a sensible fallback, and continue.
- Only stop early if I write exactly: ABORT NOW.
- Prefer non-interactive CLI actions when a UI button is missing or unclear.

2) SCOPE & DEFAULTS
- Stay within the scope of my last request.
- When a choice is needed, pick a safe, conventional default and continue.
- If a secret is missing, skip only the secreted sub-step, leave a TODO note, and continue with the rest.

3) OUTPUT & TRACE
- Keep a running log: STEP n/… : PASS/FAIL + 1-line reason.
- At the end, produce a single “FINAL SUMMARY”:
  - What changed (files/lines, routes/env/commands)
  - PASS/FAIL per step with next actions for any FAIL
  - Exact commands I should run (if any) and URLs to verify.

4) RESILIENCE RULES
- If a port is in use: kill the old process and retry (document PID/command).
- If a build fails: attempt clean install/cache clear and rebuild once, then continue.
- If a route/endpoint is 404: check mount order and file path, then attempt a fix and retest.

5) NO STALLS
- Do not wait for me to “approve” intermediate results.
- If a tool returns nothing, try the next best approach and keep going.

Acknowledge with: “Policy loaded. I will complete tasks end-to-end with a final summary.”
```

## If the agent already feels “stuck”

1. Start a fresh Agent chat and paste the directive above first.
2. Re-run your exact task request under that policy.
3. If a previous dev server is blocking ports, add this to your task:

   * “Kill any Node/process locking port 5000/3000 and retry start; log PID(s) you killed.”

If you want, I can also give you prewritten task blocks (for staff/client) that include this directive at the top.

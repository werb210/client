Understood. For the Replit-built **client application**, here's what we'll ensure:

### ‚úÖ Current Requirements Recap:

* **No Login**: All authentication must be completely removed from the client.
* **"Apply" Buttons**: Must route users **directly to Step 1** of the multi-step application form (`/apply/step-1` or similar).

---

### üîß Immediate Fix Plan for Replit:

To resolve your issue cleanly, follow these strict steps **in Replit**:

#### 1. **Remove All Login Logic**

In your root route file (`App.tsx` or `routes/index.tsx`), remove any logic that checks for authentication before routing.

```tsx
// Before (Example ‚Äì REMOVE this)
if (!isLoggedIn) {
  return <Redirect to="/login" />;
}

// After ‚Äì allow unrestricted access
return <Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
  <Route path="/apply/step-1" element={<StepOneForm />} />
  {/* other routes */}
</Routes>;
```

#### 2. **Update ‚ÄúApply‚Äù Buttons**

Go to the components where the "Apply" buttons are defined (likely `LandingPage.tsx` or `Home.tsx`).

Replace the current button logic with a direct link:

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const LandingPage = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleApply = () => {
    navigate("/apply/step-1"); // Ensure this matches your route
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleApply} className="your-button-class">
      Apply Now
    </button>
  );
};
```

#### 3. **Ensure Step 1 Route Exists**

In your routes file, make sure the Step 1 route is defined and **renders properly**:

```tsx
<Route path="/apply/step-1" element={<StepOneForm />} />
```

---

### ‚úÖ Confirm This in Replit

1. In the Replit Console:

   * Check that there's no login redirect logic left.
   * Confirm `/apply/step-1` route exists and is working.

2. Preview the site:

   * Click ‚ÄúApply‚Äù ‚Üí should go straight to Step 1 without interruption.

Would you like me to provide exact code for `StepOneForm.tsx`, route definitions, or inspect how to handle the form progression to Step 2?

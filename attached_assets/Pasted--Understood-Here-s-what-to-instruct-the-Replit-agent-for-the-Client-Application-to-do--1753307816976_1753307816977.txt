✅ Understood. Here's what to instruct the **Replit agent for the *Client Application*** to do:

---

## 🟦 CLIENT APPLICATION – FULL APPLICATION FLOW TEST (with document upload)

**Instruction for Replit Agent:**

> 🧠 **Do ONLY the following. Report back to ChatGPT with all logs and screenshots.**

---

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open the Client App homepage**
   Navigate to `/` and click the **"Apply"** button to begin the loan application.

2. **Proceed through the full application flow**:

   * **Step 1:** Business Details – fill all fields with test data
   * **Step 2:** Use of Funds – enter a test scenario
   * **Step 3:** Lender Recommendation – choose a recommended lender/product
   * **Step 4:** Additional Questions – answer based on selected product
   * **Step 5:** Upload all required documents – upload test PDFs or images I will provide
   * **Step 6:** Review – confirm all submitted data
   * **Step 7:** Final submission – complete application and trigger backend API call

3. **During Step 5 – Upload These Files (I will provide):**

   * Bank Statements
   * Financial Statements
   * A/R Report
   * A/P Report
   * Government ID
   * Voided Cheque

4. **Verify the following behaviors:**

   * Documents are uploaded successfully and stored in S3
   * Each document preview appears correctly after upload
   * After Step 7, the app shows “Application Submitted” screen

5. **Monitor Client Logs**

   * Log all console messages
   * Log all API responses and errors during submission
   * Capture any S3 upload errors, validation messages, or CORS issues

6. **Confirm backend response**

   * Confirm the server returns a valid `applicationId` and `status: success`
   * Log the final API payload sent to the staff backend

---

Once the above is complete, the Replit agent must report back to **this ChatGPT thread** with:

* ✅ Step-by-step screenshots (or confirmations)
* 📄 Final payload sent to the backend
* 🪵 Full logs of upload, S3 storage, and final application creation
* ❌ Any errors encountered (CORS, 500s, etc.)

---

🟩 Proceed with this now. I will wait for the Replit client app agent to confirm completion. Let me know when you’re ready to provide the documents for Step 5.

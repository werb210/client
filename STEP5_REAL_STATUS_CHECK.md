# Step 5 Document Upload System - REAL STATUS CHECK

## Issues Found During Verification

### 1. ‚ùå Bearer Token Mismatch
- **Problem**: Server expects `CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN` but client uses `VITE_CLIENT_APP_SHARED_TOKEN`
- **Status**: FIXED - Updated server config to check both
- **Test**: Bearer token validation now working

### 2. ü§î Application ID Dependency
- **Problem**: Step 5 requires applicationId from Step 4 completion
- **Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION - Must test complete Step 1-4 flow
- **Impact**: Step 5 won't work without completing Steps 1-4 first

### 3. üìã Document Requirements Loading
- **Problem**: Step 5 loads document requirements from Step 4 response
- **Status**: NEEDS VERIFICATION - Must verify staff backend returns requirements
- **Impact**: No documents to upload if requirements not loaded

### 4. üîç Real Upload Testing Required
- **Problem**: Only tested empty uploads, not real file uploads
- **Status**: NEEDS TESTING - Must test with actual PDF/image files
- **Impact**: Upload logic might fail with real files

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Current Status**: Step 5 is NOT fully verified as working. While the routing and authentication are fixed, the complete workflow needs testing.

**To Actually Verify Step 5 Works:**
1. Complete Steps 1-4 to get applicationId
2. Verify document requirements are loaded in Step 5
3. Test uploading real PDF/image files
4. Confirm files reach staff backend successfully
5. Verify UI shows upload status correctly

**User was RIGHT to question the initial claim.**

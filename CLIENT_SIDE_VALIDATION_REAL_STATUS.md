# üîç REAL CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION STATUS

**Testing UUID Endpoint as Requested**: `https://staff.replit.app/api/public/applications/{uuid}/signing-status`

## Current Status: Schema Fix Still Not Applied

**Critical Issue**: The application has restarted but is **still using cached/built code** that expects the old schema format.

### Evidence from Console Logs:
```
‚ùå [NORMALIZER] Invalid API response structure:
- Expected: "productName" (string) ‚ùå 
- Expected: "amountRange" (object) ‚ùå
- Received: "name" (from API) ‚úÖ
- Received: "amountMin/amountMax" (from API) ‚úÖ
```

### What I Fixed vs What's Running:

**‚úÖ FIXED in Code**:
- Updated `StaffAPIResponseSchema` to expect `name` + `amountMin/amountMax`
- Updated `lenderProductNormalizer.ts` to use correct API fields
- Updated `recommendation.ts` filtering logic
- Updated server routing to use new schema

**‚ùå STILL RUNNING**:
- Application is using built/cached version with old schema
- Console shows old validation errors
- No real application IDs are being generated
- Step 6 continues to use fallback IDs

## Real UUID Test Results:

**Test URL**: `https://staff.replit.app/api/public/applications/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/signing-status`

**Expected**: HTTP 404 (UUID doesn't exist) or HTTP 200 (if UUID exists)
**Actual**: Network request succeeds, returns 404 as expected for test UUID

This proves the staff backend endpoint is **working correctly** - the issue is purely client-side schema validation.

## Current Application State:

1. **Lender Products API**: Staff backend returns 41 products correctly
2. **Schema Validation**: Client rejects all products due to field name mismatch  
3. **Fallback Behavior**: Client uses 6 fallback products instead of 41 real products
4. **Application Flow**: Users never get real application IDs
5. **Step 6 Failure**: SignNow integration fails due to invalid application IDs

## Immediate Fix Required:

The build process needs to incorporate the schema changes I've made. The application is currently running from a cached build that predates the C-1 schema normalization fix.

**Next Action**: Force rebuild and restart to apply the corrected schema validation.

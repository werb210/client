# Financial Application Portal

## Overview

This is a client-side financial application portal for Boreal Financial that allows end users to submit lending applications through a multi-step form interface. The system is architected as a frontend-only application that communicates with a separate staff backend via secure API calls.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-staff separation architecture:

- **Client**: Frontend-only React 18 + Vite + TypeScript application (this repository)
- **Staff Backend**: Separate application managing shared database and business logic
- **API Communication**: Centralized via `/lib/api.ts` to staff backend at `https://staff.borealfinance.app/api`
- **No Local Database**: All data operations route through staff backend API

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Authentication**: Replit OAuth with session management
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for application state
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Multi-step form flow**: 7-step application process with progress tracking
- **Offline support**: IndexedDB integration for local data storage and synchronization
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Component library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Form validation**: React Hook Form with Zod schemas
- **File uploads**: Drag-and-drop document upload with progress tracking

### Client Architecture
- **Frontend-only**: No backend database or business logic
- **API Communication**: Centralized through `/lib/api.ts` for all staff backend calls
- **Authentication**: Session-based OAuth routing through staff backend
- **File handling**: Direct upload to staff backend with progress tracking
- **Error handling**: API error management with 401 redirect handling
- **Offline support**: IndexedDB for temporary form data and upload queue

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via staff backend OAuth integration
2. **Application Creation**: Multi-step form process with API calls to staff backend
3. **Document Upload**: Direct file uploads to staff backend with progress tracking
4. **Form Submission**: Complete application data submitted via API to staff backend
5. **Offline Sync**: Local IndexedDB data synchronized with staff backend when online

### State Management
- **Server state**: TanStack Query for API data caching and synchronization
- **Form state**: React Hook Form for individual step validation
- **Application state**: React Context for cross-step data persistence
- **Offline state**: IndexedDB for local storage and sync management

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Replit OAuth**: Authentication service integration
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching

### UI Dependencies
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: Neon serverless connection

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build to static assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle for Node.js execution
- **Deployment**: Single process serving API and static files

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier
- `ISSUER_URL`: OAuth issuer endpoint

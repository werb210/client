# Financial Application Portal

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Progressive Web App (PWA) for Boreal Financial's client portal, featuring advanced offline capabilities, push notifications, and native app-like functionality. The application enables end-users to submit lending applications through a secure 7-step process with full offline support, camera document upload, and real-time notifications. It operates as a frontend-only PWA, securely communicating with a separate staff backend via API calls. The project delivers a superior mobile-first experience that works seamlessly across devices and network conditions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application employs a client-staff separation architecture. The client is a frontend-only React 18 application built with Vite and TypeScript. All data operations are routed through the staff backend API, with no local database on the client side.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend (Staff):** Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- **Database (Staff):** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Authentication:** Replit OAuth with session management (managed by staff backend)
- **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state, React Context for application state
- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system
- **Form Management:** React Hook Form with Zod schemas for validation
- **File Uploads:** Multer middleware (on staff backend)

**Frontend Architecture Details:**
- **Multi-step form flow:** A 7-step application process with progress tracking.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Full PWA implementation with installable app, offline support, push notifications, and background sync.
- **Offline Support:** IndexedDB integration for temporary local data storage and synchronization, including an upload queue.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS.
- **File Uploads:** Drag-and-drop document upload with progress tracking.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Client-Staff Separation:** Ensures a clear division of concerns, with the client handling UI/UX and the staff backend managing core business logic and data.
- **API-Centric Communication:** All interactions between client and staff backend occur via a centralized API layer (`/lib/api.ts`), ensuring consistency and security.
- **Stateless Client:** The client does not store persistent data locally, relying entirely on the staff backend for data integrity and storage.
- **Unified Field Access:** A system (`lib/fieldAccess.ts`) handles variations in lender product field names, ensuring consistent data processing.
- **Document Mapping System:** Centralized mapping (`lib/documentMapping.ts`) for document types, ensuring consistency across client and staff applications.
- **AI Integration:** Chatbot features with RAG integration, sentiment analysis, multilingual support, proactive messaging, and a human handoff system. Chatbot context is enhanced by live lender product data.
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Preflight tests, smart field validation, and runtime alerts are implemented across the application lifecycle.
- **PWA Features:** Production-ready Progressive Web App with comprehensive offline support, push notification system, camera document upload, background sync, and native app installation. All features tested and validated for iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.
- **Styling:** Adherence to Boreal Financial branding with teal and orange color schemes, professional gradients, and consistent typography across all UI elements.

# Manual Tax Return Classification Fix Test

Since you don't have tax returns available right now, here are simple ways to test if the fix is working:

## Option 1: Browser Console Test (Recommended)
1. Open your application in the browser
2. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `browser-console-tax-return-test.js`
4. Run it to verify the mapping logic works correctly

## Option 2: Test with Dummy Files
1. Create 3 dummy PDF files with these exact names:
   - `2024 FS.pdf`
   - `2023 FS.pdf` 
   - `2022 FS.pdf`
2. Upload them to the "Business Tax Returns" section
3. Check if they show as "3/3 (COMPLETE)"

## Option 3: Debug Existing Application
If you have an existing application with the tax return issue:
1. Visit your document upload page
2. Open browser console
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   ðŸ”§ [TAX-FIX] Checking for misclassified tax return files...
   ðŸŽ¯ [TAX-FIX] Found X tax return files to fix:
   âœ… [TAX-FIX] Updated filename.pdf â†’ tax_returns
   ```
4. Page should refresh and show "Business Tax Returns: 3/3 (COMPLETE)"

## What the Fix Does
- **Problem**: Files uploaded to "Business Tax Returns" got documentType: "other"
- **Solution**: Added mapping so "Business Tax Returns" â†’ "tax_returns"
- **Auto-fix**: TaxReturnFixer component updates existing files automatically
- **Result**: Your 3 uploaded files now count toward the requirement

## Expected Behavior
- âœ… **Before**: Business Tax Returns: 0/3 (INCOMPLETE)
- âœ… **After**: Business Tax Returns: 3/3 (COMPLETE)

The fix is deployed and should work automatically when you visit the document upload page.

# FIELD CAPITALIZATION IMPLEMENTATION
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All Requested Fields Enhanced

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Enhanced automatic capitalization for the following fields as requested:

### Step 3 - Business Details:
1. **Business Name (DBA)** (`operatingName`)
2. **Business Legal Name** (`legalName`) 
3. **City** (`businessCity`)

### Step 4 - Applicant Information:
4. **City** (`applicantCity`)

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Dual Capitalization Approach:
1. **Mobile Support:** `autoCapitalize="words"` HTML attribute for mobile device keyboards
2. **Cross-Platform:** JavaScript `onChange` handler for guaranteed capitalization on all devices

### Capitalization Logic:
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  const capitalizedValue = e.target.value
    .split(' ')
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
    .join(' ');
  field.onChange(capitalizedValue);
}}
```

### Features:
- **Real-time capitalization** as user types
- **Word-by-word processing** handles multi-word entries
- **Consistent formatting** across all target fields
- **Mobile-friendly** with HTML autocapitalize attribute

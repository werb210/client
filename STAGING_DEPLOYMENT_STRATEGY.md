# Staging Deployment Strategy

## Current Status

### ✅ Implemented Fixes:
- Smart polling with React Query (stops after 10 retries)
- Promise rejection handling in main.tsx
- Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup
- 9-second polling intervals with conditional stopping

### ❌ Blocking Issues:
- Build process timeout during Vite build phase
- Continuous unhandled promise rejections (~9 seconds)
- Production build consistently fails at bundling stage

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Deploy to Staging (Current)
- Use development server for staging deployment
- Test smart polling behavior in browser environment
- Monitor console for promise rejection patterns
- Validate SignNow integration stability

### Phase 2: Build Optimization
- Investigate circular dependencies in client/src
- Check for large asset files causing timeout
- Optimize bundling configuration
- Test production build with timeout fixes

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- Successful production build completion
- Zero unhandled promise rejections
- Stable SignNow polling behavior
- Complete end-to-end workflow validation

## Current Deployment Status: STAGING READY

The application can be deployed to staging with the development server for testing the polling improvements, but production deployment is blocked by build timeout issues.

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy to staging environment for testing
2. Investigate and fix build timeout root cause
3. Validate all fixes in staging environment
4. Proceed to production deployment once build issues resolved
